Please tell us more about your cultural background and identity in the space below.
For the first four years of my life, my sisters and I were taken care of by my grandmother in Puebla. My life changed when I crossed the border with my sisters just after I turned five. The only image I remember of my life in Mexico was a shrine dedicated to La Virgen de Guadalupe - my family's goddess. From the first time I saw my mother in New York, I became a fusion of two cultures. In school, I'm known as Karl: the Vim God who takes Chinese and has studs. And at home, I'm known as Jesus: a catholic who watches anime in Spanish, and a proud grandfather of six budgies. I'm not quite sure who I fully am, but I know one thing: I'm neither American nor Mexican — I'm both, but also more.

Tell us more about why this field of study at MIT appeals to you. (100 words or fewer)*
Computer Science has always infatuated me. With a couple of bytes, I could produce an incremental parser that would help visualize gene mutations through the form of a syntax tree. To me, Computer Science is not just a hobby — it is an art of creation. I yearn to combine my boundless knowledge of this art with Biology to create tools and algorithms that will develop humanity's understanding of genes. Studying at MIT will allow me to focus on both my interests in a concise program through Course 6-7, and have the opportunity to work alongside computational leaders like Christopher Burge.

If there is anything we should know about your school's grading system or course offerings (including disruptions due to COVID-19), please use the space below.
My school is acting under a blended model, where 70% of students are fully remote, and the other 30% opted to return to school on certain days. Due to this, my school's budget had to be lower, and some classes had to be cut. In my case, I would have liked to take AP Calculus BC, however, with the budget cut, there was a lack of seats. I'm planning to self-study for the AP test if possible. Additionally, because of this budget issue, I was not able to take Cybersecurity, a post-AP Computer Science A class I was looking forward to taking.

Finally, throughout High School, I had a 504 plan that limited the number of classes I was able to take during a school year.

Honestly, one of the reasons why I am applying to your school is because I see the "MIT License" under a lot of GitHub projects. Combine that with the fact that the text editor EMACS was developed in the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at MIT, I knew that this is a school that would care about open source projects as much as I care about them. I understand these are such silly reasons, but it means a lot that through the license you give programmers the freedom to develop and distribute code as they wish.
