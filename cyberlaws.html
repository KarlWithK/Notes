Hello, first of all, I'm sorry. I don't mean to enforce my views or bring them into this chat, but I feel like I have to talk about this. 
</p>

<p>
For the last four years of my life, I have watched as subtly more regulations from the government were placed onto the internet. I'm sure that this doesn't mean a lot for most people here, but it's been painful for me. During these past few years, I started to realize that most people are taking the web for granted. I was genuinely happy when many people got pissed off that the government was banning TikTok. Thanks to this, people were able to acknowledge how much power the government had on the applications we used daily. Trust me when I say this, but TikTok was not banned because the government cared about you - it was more or less an economic reason. A lack of revenue per se. However, after the ordeal ended, most TikTok users forgot the "reason" why TikTok was going to be banned - your privacy.
</p>

<p>
I don't care what applications people use - I'm not bashing your taste in TikTok. What I do care about is your privacy. During middle school, I started to become aware of how important the web was for me, and that was when I heard of net neutrality. I made powerpoints and posts on social media to make people hear about the changes repealing net neutrality would have. That didn't work out. Fortunately, the outcome was alright - net neutrality was repelled, but states could introduce their laws to the equation. In theory, places like New York City could make sure that net neutrality is still respected.
</p>


<p>
The thing is, for me, the outcome wasn't enough. The truth was that most people did not give a damn. Therefore, even if this does nothing, I would like to inform you about something you should care about: the EARN IT Act (<a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/10/urgent-earn-it-act-introduced-house-representatives).">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/10/urgent-earn-it-act-introduced-house-representatives).</a> The act was just passed by the Senate Judiciary Committee, and today it is starting to be reviewed by the House of Representatives. In theory, the act is great: it would allow website owners to be sued or prosecuted if there is an offense to a minor. This might sound like it's protecting children, but in reality, it might be causing the destruction of safe spaces for many communities. Think about it: many LGBT+ members use social media to secure themselves, to ask for support, or make friends with others if their situation at home isn't great. Having an act like this may shut this down as companies would be less willing to allow minors to talk on their websites. Not only that, but normal users might be censored more than ever to make certain offenses don't take place. While there may be good intentions behind the act, it isn't a positive thing for the internet.
</p>


<p>
Look, I'm not sure if many are aware of this, but to me, the biggest issue in first world countries are cyber laws. The very laws that will decide how the internet will run are being decided NOW, and people aren't paying attention. My biggest fear is that in ten years, people will realize how much we screwed up and how powerless they will be to change the web back. I'm sure to some I may sound paranoid, but I have loved technology ever since I was born, and I have seen how much it has changed since then. I only have the best interest in mind for everyone's sake as I speak on this issue.
</p>


<p>
The internet/your computer/social media is a tool. Everyone should use them. You don't need to love computer science or technology to realize how important they are in the modern world. However, I urge you to please spread this information out. To do something before it's too late. Thank you.
