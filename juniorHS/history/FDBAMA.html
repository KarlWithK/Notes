Kennedy used a combination of pathos and logos in John F. Kennedy Speakes On the Religious Issue to diffused criticism about their identifies. Kennedy states, "Finally, I believe in an America where religious intolerance will someday end; where all men and all churches as equal; where every man has the same right to attend or not attend the church at the time". Here Kennedy is appealing to the audience, he knows that trait of every American is "freedom", and thus appeals to them using words like right. As he does this, he uses logos to drive his main point: don't judge a man for his background but for his contributions - something which I believe should be common sense. This led people to respect him as true Americans would do do just that. If they didn't...well they weren't "true" Americans.k.

Obama, in a similar way to JFK addressed the problem directly. And in his address, Obama really used ethos in his speech; he would give an overview of the nation's past history and present his overview as facts to back his points up. For example, "The disparities that exist between the African American community and the larger American community can be traced directly to inequalities pass on from an earlier generation that suffered under the brutal legacy of slavery and Jim Crow." This allows him to bring the point that there is a reason why many African Americans are angered and it is justified. However, he is not from Wright's generation and because he is mixed race, he can bring people together. His uses of just using ethos to present the facts and not criticize Wright really makes him stand out as the "bigger man".

Finally, both presidents use amplification to suggest what a true American would do. For example, Obama suggest that Americans can change. In his speech he repeats Americans to show possible suggestions of what a true American. Americans need "unity" and he keeps repeating this point. Kennedy, again, does the same and repeats that America should see past a person's background as it is what America is based on. The use of the presidents' amplification are used as a way to transfer their expectations to the common - but still whole blooded - Americans. They use it as a means to make America "better".
