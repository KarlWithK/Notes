FDR's First Inaugural Address (1933)
</p>
<ol>
<li>
The reason why Americans let Democrats basically win the election of 1932, is because they showed no efforts to help Americans in this desperate time of need. As the textbook stated the reason why Hoover won the 1928 election was because republicans had been in government for so long and they had a reputation. They were stable and Americans were OK with that, however, that was before the depression. Hoover faced the first few years of the depression and struggled to get help the common American with their need. Thus, when it came time for reelection, Hoover and the republicans were defeated by the Democrats. They showed more promised then the republicans.

<li>
Roosevelt knew that as long as people worked together, they would get through this time period. He stated in his speech that the problems they had were "materials" and not the people.So he was sure he could fix it. Hoover, however, because of his republicans nature did not have the ideas to solve the problem, thus he we felt he was at his end.

<li>
Roosevelt offered the American a promise a solution to the Great Depression. He said he was going to honest and to recognize the problems people are facing now. He promises to put an to speculation and fix the world trade. Finally, to give people jobs.

<li>
The themes Roosevelt sets forth for America are: federal help, government can interfere in trading, and jobs.

<li>
Roosevelt states: "There are many ways in which it can be helped, but it can never be helped merely by talking about it". Thus, he implies that the government will actively partake in the process of making America great again. Also, he states he will present a new congress.

<li>
At first I thought that no one would believe him, since the previous president was unable to do anything. Also, in this period of desperation, people had given up hope. However, it's exactly for that reason that I think that some people believe him. They had no hope so they would take in any.
