1982, would have become an amendment. Plafker's friend - Stacie Brensilver, PHD. Stonewall is a major turning point that led to a movement. 67,68 was anti war. The stone wall riots were everywhere. Martin Boyce. Mafia run but gay(?). Stonewall allowed any one to come in for a drink. Arc was there but people were trying to hide their faces, and the drag queen attack the police men. However, people stepped into the policemen when they called someone "fag". Closeted life. It was a cave for them - a safe place. Total freedom. Two different lives. Danger but here there was control. End of june. But a riot was full of sweat, but you still moved. People started to throw pennies but then more. One queen become a leader. Had to fight for your friend. Storm troopers and tactical patrol force came in. People were hit, but people kept rioting. Street was with glitter. People started to support them. Made gay right activists a reality. Stone wall made an impact to everything. A parade make impact. June 6, 2019. Were wrong, but what about now.

Silence spring was a call warning wide spread ddt use. 1970, Earth day was born. EPA nixon, was born. President Clinton's treaty did not pass because they need to pass by the senate.

Chemical meant good economy. 1978, and he develop diseases. Chemical dumps were going into love canal. Leaking poisons were causing diseases. Only pay to move away. Worthless homes. Patience ran out. Holding two officials until they got relocated.

Ok, I am pretty sure a lot of people have talked about stonewall so I am going to share my thoughts on the second video. To add context, during the 2016 election, I heard some rumor or some people talk about how some chemicals in some water source were turning frogs gay. That had to be a joke, right? Unfortunately, I am pretty sure some people really believed that. I couldn't believe it, but when I saw today's video about the love canal and how that lady's son was diagnosis with autism and other diseases it made me think that people do have a reason to kinda (although the claim is still ridiculous) believe that chemicals might be doing something. I mean it makes sense in a way: drink poison and you will die. So is it so far fetch to believe that water containing dangerous chemicals might induce problems to a kid? I don't think so. Again, the frogs-gay theory is not true, but I would see why people fall into a trap like this. Honestly, this is why protests are a two way coin. There could be good outcome...depending on what the protest is for. Although, I guess you would call it a hate rally if it was for a hate symbol. Either way, I think it makes sense to protest like we do for Earth day. We need to protect our home. Although, it's number #1 in domestic affairs, nothing is really being done by the current administration. As a side note, the ending of a first video where a person from NYC was apologizing for what they did in Stonewall in 2017. It got me thinking, that in 50 years they will be saying the same thing about now.

You have a shout out to your friend, Stacie Brensilver who has a PHD. She talked about stonewall and how that really impacted the ability for gay pride to be more common.
