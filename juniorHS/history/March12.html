<ul>
<li>
Spanish Civil War (1936 -39), 2800 Americans volunteers took up arms to defend the Spanish republic against General Franco, a leader for the Spanish people.

<li>
Together with some other nationals they formed the Fifteenth International Brigade. +125 Americans as help

<li>
Volunteering was born from the economic calamity and political turmoil of the 30s. Young volunteers had experience the unfairness of life and made them want to join the fight against fascism. They were influenced by the Communist Party (CP). Their success gave rise to a revolutionary Ã©lan.

<li>
American radicalism was spurred by profascist groups like the Livery League and the expansed of fascism. With the expansion of fascism, the CP responded with the coalition -building strategy of the Popular Front. Spurred the progressive communities to fight against fascism in Madrid. Americans did everything they could even against a travel ban.

<li>
The Lincolns were from everywhere and establish the first racially integrated military unit in US History and were the first to be led by a black commander. Many progressives joined (60%).

<li>
Reaction to the war was ambivalent and duplicitous, policies intended to De-escalate the war but whose selective enforcement undermined the Republic. Germany gave more to Franco and America only prevented arms from reaching the republic.

<li>
Lincolns attempted to create an egalitarian "people's army". Soldiers could sometimes elected their own officers. Traditional military protocol was shunned, and soldiers were explained the politics of the war.

<li>
The Brigade helped ease the pressure on Madrid, and helped strengthen anti-fascist opinion in the US.

<li>
The fascist were strong and the anti-fascist force lost against them. Many injured. Madrid fell to the fascist in 1939, but the Lincolns returned home as heroes but without any official recognition of their deeds.

<li>
The Lincolns were confined to their bases and had to protest to see actions.

<li>
Core agents of the Office of Strategic Services were Lincoln Veterans whose contacts were key to OSS missions.

<li>
Most veterans were harassed or forced out of their jobs by the FBI and the Communists Lincolns were hit hard by the Smith Act, Subversive Activities Control Board, and state sedition laws

<li>
"Abraham Lincoln Brigade commands attention as a unique example of prescient, radical, and selfless action in the cause of international freedom."
