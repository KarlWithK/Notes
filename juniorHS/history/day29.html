Little Richard was a challenge to America in the 1950's because of two things 1) race and 2) teenagers and morals. The former is pretty simple: during the 1950s was a period of segregation - before the civil rights movement. People were not allowed to mix. Yet as stated in the CNN article, by the end of a concert "they would all be mixed together" and having fun to his music. He inadvertently attacked America's divide with his music and he did that on road. To the second point, Richard's music and Rock 'n' roll attracted American - even teenagers. The 1950 was a period of teenage exploration and baby explosion. Teenagers were attracted to the genre and when Richard sang it, he attracted these teenagers to him. The genre was known as the "devil's music", because it talked or suggested sex and he was very "flamboyant". When his music was played people thought it was not for God's children. Thus, he challenged the morals of American's by introducing the music.

Little Richard was the self proclaimed "architect of rock 'n' roll"- meaning he was the one who planned out and created how the genre would turn out. Turns out this meant that he would be bringing Rock 'n' Roll to the whole World. His music was very emotional, and because of that people could express themselves through it in ways they couldn't before. Rock 'n' Roll was a term for sex, and through his music he could express some terms people would not hear before. This is definitely has impact today, where people could talk about anything in music. The fact that Rock 'n' Roll has there own hall of fame and he is in it demonstrates how successful he was at promoting Rock 'n' Roll.
