How do you think children's education AND comedy will continue to evolve through this pandemic?

Fed Chairman Jay Powell begins to talk to about Sesame Street.
David Cap talks about how Sesame Street was made to close the gap on education by using the TV. He wonders if things like zoom can close that gap too since students/ children are watching more TV than ever. People were worried that TVs would rot the brains of children. David thinks that Sesame Street although it did not close the gap between the rich and poor, but it offers a lift to everyone. It proved that children could learn from screen. Sesame Sesame took about 3 years to plan and had to work with educators to prepare. However, online learning was not that well planned out. They made sure that people who did not have TV would have a chance to watch Sesame Street.

I didn't do the lesson with my parents, but I don't think they would be offended by this kind of humor. It's history. Anyway, I think today's lecture talked about Sesame Street and it's origin was really interesting because As David Cap(?) and Kai saying, the TV and our current situation where we use video meets are similar. Personally, I think that kid shows will evolve on television. TV shows can adapt more quickly, however, on youtube... I am not sure because they are unregulated. I have a nephew and all he watches is toys reviews and they don't really teach him anything - just pure entertainment. What I am trying to say is that I am not sure if big kid channels on youtube will change that much. At least they won't mention COVID-19 directly. One of the reasons for this is that YouTube places a banner for COVID-19 if it is related to the topic and might not consider it "Kid friendly". However, I think that there will be more content online for kids that are not below the age of 8. Just a guess.

I also believe that in some way, a person's mouth will be something that kids will be taught to not show. I don't know how to explain what I mean, but basically because everyone is wearing masks, there is a possibility  that showing your mouth is going to be considered rude or inappropriate like one of the "7 words you can't say on television".

Overall, however, I am pretty sure companies will take advantage of kids and start to invest more in Kids shows. Spectrum for example gave a 60 day trial for Internet access - similar to the way the creators of Sesame Street went around poor neighbors showing the show. It is quite apparent to me that the things we are doing now will be influenced by these cooperations one way or another. At the very least there will be more resource for education, but I am not sure whether kid's comedy will change. But i think there will be more adults shows that just make fun of unreasonable people who act entitled during this pandemic.
