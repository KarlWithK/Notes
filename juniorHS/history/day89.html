Watching The Chinatown Files taught me a new aspect of American history or McCarthyism like...

<li>
I wonder how many Americans know that the Chinese and Chinese/American were uniquely impacted by McCarthyism. I think they should learn...

<li>
My own family was impacted by McCarthyism (regardless of country of origin) by...

</ol>

<p>
McCarthyism "means calling a man a communist who is later proved to be one." while not exactly the same, this ideology is most like racial profiling that we currently have. I used to live in a mostly African American neighborhood in Brooklyn, and now that I'm older I am reminded of the comments were about my old neighborhood. "we weren't clean, we were poor, and we were dumb." my old neighborhood is beautiful to me. I go there every weekend (I used to before the lockdown). But at my age, I am used to being profiled in one way or another. People always joke around that I jump from the border. Before this unit I didn't really understand or know that McCarthyism existed: but the idea was there for my family and I. Much like the people from the film, we send money back home to Mexico. Like the Chinese citizens from that age share sentiments that we were American but we still had ties to our families in Mexico. I don't really tell people this because I think it would take long to understand - at to people who call their selves "true Americans".
</p>

<p>
I think one of the worst moments, for my family and my culture had was when president Donald trump stated that my race were "rapists" and Mexico were not sending their best. Often to support this he would present a case were an undocumented immigrant had killed an American, but not to mention that "aliens" have "arrest rates" are " were well below those of native-born Americans" (<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/03/us/immigrants-crime-numbers/index.html).">https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/03/us/immigrants-crime-numbers/index.html).</a> Yes, a few undocumented immigrants have killed and those could have been prevented, but coming from America, who has the highest crime rate in the world, it's kinda ironic. For the latter part of trump's statement, I know a lot of Mexicans, and for example, my dad, who are the hardest workers. I am not here to justify immigration problems but I believe that McCarthyism is definitely an inspiration for profiling for other groups.
</p>

<p>
For Mexicans, being labeled an undocumented immigrant is the equivalent to being labeled a communist that was for Chinese citizen in the McCarthyism era. In fact, some of the operations of ice demonstrates this. There have been cases where ice arrested American citizens because they thought they were undocumented. McCarthyism assumes that a race is a certain type of person even if it isn't true. It took a whole year before that citizen was freed and their name was clear. This was like when "communists", who were not actually communists, were put in to jail because they were reported.
</p>

<p>
Finally, a final inspiration of McCarthyism can be traced to hate crimes. For example, the el Paso scooting that occurred in 2019. The shooter left a manifesto that was anti-Hispanic and had anti-immigrant sentiment. I remember talking to my dad about it, the whole incident, and this is where my opinion is going into place: my dad and I agreed that this happened because trump did not do anything that discourage this kind of behavior - in fact we agreed that he encouraged it. McCarthyism might have essentially targeted communisms, but it affected other races, and encouraged more hate.

Thank you ms. Plakfer for this documentation. It made me realize a lot of things.
