DH: The National Recovery Administration
<a href="http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/disp_textbook.cfm?smtID=2&amp;psid=3442">http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/disp_textbook.cfm?smtID=2&amp;psid=3442</a>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
National Recovery Administration (NRA) to help revive industry and labor through rational planning: leaders would establish codes of fair practices that would set prices, production levels, minimum wages, and maximum hours within each industry.

<li>
NRA also supported workers to join unions.

<li>
Led by General Hugh Johnson. At first the agency was successful with the nation's ten largest industries displaying the "Blue Eagle", the insignia of the NRA, but it was short-lived. As Johnson was overzealous who alienated many businesspeople. 

<li>
The leaders of the big companies drafted codes that favored their interests over those of small competitors, while also resenting the NRA. Made fun of them by saying it stood for "National run-around"

<li>
Codes help abolished child labor and established the precedent of federal regulation on labor laws. They also boosted labor movement by drawing workers into unions, but the codes set wages below what industries demanded. Many workers fell outside the coder's coverage.

</ul>

DH: Jobs Programs

<ul>
<li>
Harry Hopkins convinced Roosevelt to hire workers into the federal government.

</ul>
<li>
Public Works Administration (PWA) was the first major program to attack unemployment. Serve as a "pump-primer", providing people with money to spend on industrial products. They spent 6Bil on building projects but Harold Ickes was so cautious that the PWA did not reduce unemployment that much.

<li>
Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) hired 300K young men to work in the nation's parks and forests. By 1942, 2.5M had serve in the "Tree Army", but because it excluded women, imposed rigid quotas on blacks and only offered some jobs, it failed to make a serious dent in unemployment.

<li>
Civil Works Administration led by Harry Hopkins put over 6.6 M to work on city projects But it was scrapped in March 1934, because it would create a permanent dependent class / budget deficit.

<li>
Roosevelt underestimated the severity of the crisis and the depression deepened in 1934. On labor day, 500K went on strike and criticize Roosevelt for not doing enough.

<li>
After 1934, Democrats won seats in congress, and Roosevelt abandoned his hopes for a balanced budget. He decided that the only road was government spending, he crated more federal jobs for the unemployed.

<li>
1935, created the Work Progress Administration and employed 3.5 M at a "security wage" -- twice the level of welfare payments but below unions scales. Led by Harry Hopkins, he opted for labor-intensive task that were inefficient. Joked that it stood for "We Piddle Along" but by 41 pumped $11 B into economy.

<li>
WPA spent 5% of its spending to cultural programs where they hired artists to work. The Farm Security Agency (FSA) employed photographers to create art. Federal Writers Project to write about tales. Oral historians to collect narratives and musicologist complied folk music. Theater project and art project.

<li>
WPA - more jobs and established the precedent of federal support to the arts and humanities. Support for programs to promote the life of the mind in the US. Both loved and hated.

<li>
Works did everything inefficient and were not payed equal to those of the private sector. Avoided cost-saving machinery to hire more works. Spent a lot per year.

DH: Wagner Act
<a href="http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/disp_textbook.cfm?smtID=2&amp;psid=3445">http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/disp_textbook.cfm?smtID=2&amp;psid=3445</a>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
George Barnett in 1932, president of the American Economics Association, things seem bleached for organ labor.

<li>
Union support was going down, and a lot of industries remained unorganized.

<li>
Wagner Act (National Labor Relations Act) was passed in 1935. Help unions win. Auto workers trike in Flint, Michigan in 1937. General Motors recognize the Unite Automobile Worker union

<li>
Many industries went on strike as the depression went on, some aimed for higher wages but others demanded union recognition. 

<li>
This forced the government to step in and forge a compromise between the two. Under the act, the federal government guaranteed the right of employees to form unions and to bargain collectively and set the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), which had the power to prohibit unfair labor practices by employers.

<li>
Dispute in unions: all workers or just skilled ones? John L. Lewis of United Mine Workers and David Dubinsky of Amalgamated Clothing Workers and Sidney Hillman of the Inter nation Ladies' Garment Workers formed the Committee of Industrial Organization (CIO ) to organize unskilled workers in America's mass production industries. Had more members than the American Federation of Labor.

<li>
Memorial day massacre forced the Steel companies to recognize the United Steelwork's of America

</ul>

<p>
DH: Social Security Act
<a href="http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/disp_textbook.cfm?smtID=2&amp;psid=3446">http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/disp_textbook.cfm?smtID=2&amp;psid=3446</a>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Social Security Act, aimed to alleviate the plight of American's visibly poor, the elderly, dependent children and the handicapped. Was progressive and major win for Roosevelt.

<li>
Financed by the federal government and the states, the act offered works age 65 or older monthly stipends based on previous earnings. Assisted to blind and handicapped Pecans and Children.  Established the nation's first federally-sponsored system of unemployment insurance.

<li>
Critics argued that the act place the US on the road of socialism. Disappointed reformers who wanted more. Also the payments were small and retirement system left some groups out, such as migrant workers. Finally its budget came from a regressive tax scheme that place too much stress on poor and did not offer health insurance

<li>
But it still introduce a new era in American history. Committee the government to a social welfare for Americans and expanded the publics sense of entitlement and the support people expected government to give to all citizens

</ul>

<p>
DH: Legacy of the New Deal
<a href="http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/disp_textbook.cfm?smtID=2&amp;psid=3454">http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/disp_textbook.cfm?smtID=2&amp;psid=3454</a>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The New Deal did not end the depression, nor did it redistribute income, but it did provide Americans with economic security: unemployment insurance, old age insurance, and insured bank deposits.

<li>
Wagner act reduced violence in labor relations and The securities and exchange commission protected stock market investments of millions of small investors.

<li>
The federal housing Administration and Fannie Me enabled Americans to become house owners.

<li>
A shift in Government philosophy, and Americans came to relive that the federal movement was responsible for the health of the nation's economy and welfare of citizens
