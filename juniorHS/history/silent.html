According to this <a href="https://thevietnamwar.info/silent-majority/,">https://thevietnamwar.info/silent-majority/,</a> the silent majority were most Americans who did not participate in Anti-Vietnam. By using this term, Nixon implied that most Americans were with him since they showed no aggression like the apparent opposition, the vocal minority. Since this group of people are the "majority" - they are the group that decides the outcome. A blatant example of this is when in 2016, when many polls predicted Hillary Clinton to win the presidential election, Donald J Trump actually won as many people went to vote for him. These voters were silent and thanks to them Trump won the majority of the electoral college.

Manolo Sanchez was was one of Nixon's staff members and was Nixon's friend. On May 9, 1970, Nixon along with Manolo and his secret service team went to the Lincoln Memorial to tried to the students nearby and tried to convinced them that he sympathizes for desire to end the war. According to the PBS clip, he was sincere, however, he tried to relate with the students by bringing up topics like surfing. His attempts failed.

On April 30, 1970, Nixon sent troops to invade Cambodia despite his promise to end the war when he was elected. Thus, on the following days, many students went to protest Nixon and America's involvement in the war. However, on May 4, 1970, four students were killed by the Ohio state troops who acted "self-defense". This led to the NYC Mayor at the time, Mayor John Lindsay to cast the American flag City Hall at half-mast to respect the death of the students. In addition to this, many students in NYC started to also participate in a United Nations protest. In reaction to both of these events, construction workers who proclaimed their selves  as "Vietnam tartans" would protest to that protest. These riots were called the Hard Hat riots, and would come to represent support for Nixon and the Vietnam war.
