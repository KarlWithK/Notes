Since everyone above has already stated what I would also say, I want to give another answer: journalists/ news reporter. The 50s brought great changes and in part it was because of the media. Certainly the students and the unnamed masses helped, but who helped report their stories? Who brought them to the light? I think reporters serve that purpose. For example, the news reporter in the Emmet till documentary had a chance at being killed, but instead using the tactic of using a microphone to show the killers of Till that he wasn't afraid. In a way, I think that because it's their jobs to report the new, we don't credit them. Similarly how we don't actually give benefits to healthcare workers saving people right now.

I think what compelled people to support this was the fact that it wasn't the first time that had happened. In retrospect, I believe they understood that if they stayed the way they were, then nothing was going to change. Thus, they began to boycott until they were treated like citizens despite the disadvantages.

No I have not been in a boycutt. Maybe I will grow some guts and start one. One day.
