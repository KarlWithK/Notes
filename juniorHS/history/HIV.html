I interviewed my Sister (because my parents are kinda religious), and she remembers just a bit. So at the time she was born, my parents were still in Mexico. Since my mom was a young mom she was not really worried about STDs. However, the news spread about quickly, and eventually even in my mom's small town she heard about it. My sister basically said that there was a general fear of contacting the diseases. But, HIV certainly wasn't as fear in Mexico. Because my mom's town wasn't that modern. It was kinda weird how my mom lived. My mom just heard about it on the news and my sister says she got check for it once. I really can't to my parents about this...sorry.

The main thing that made me think when my Sister said about how my mom's town didn't really care made me realized that many small rural towns today won't understand how dangerous Covid is. It's kinda weird how they didn't / won't understand because they are secluded and we here are so dense in NYC.

The real big thing that I rook from this is that your friends can turn on you very quickly. The man had HIV and his friends told him to die. I guess he got rid of those friends quickly. I think the reason for this was because many thought HIV was for homosexual people only. Which is not true, but people fell for the rumors. It's kinda disgusting how quickly people turn on each other. The other thing I took was that people of color are always being the ones suffering a lot in these epidemic. Look at coronavirus and you realize that there is some things that are mess up.
