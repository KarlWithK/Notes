			Two Stories that Might Have Nothing to Do with Each Other
	"Cradle Will Rock" was a film produced Tim Robbins that centered around the circumstances in the making of the 1937 Federal Threatre Project (FTP) production with the same name. And, honestly, at first the film confused me a lot - especially when they kept on mentioning fascists vs the "reds". My thought process was like this: the play itself was about "unionization and the limitations of capitalism", so why did the film include all this extra information? I also questioned why the film, which was supposed to be about the play, seemed like it was about two separate stories. The first story was about Marc Blitzstein and the play's crew dealing with claims about being communist and being in fear of unemployment. The other story was about trafficking paintings(?) with Nelson Rockefeller hiring Diego Rivera to paint at his building while rich people were making businesses with Mussolini through his lover? Like what? There was clearly a lot going on in the film and to fully understand the film I had to think more and read more articles. As I started to research I found out the two "stories" I was talking about historically did not occur at the same time. For example, Diego Rivera started to paint his mural in the Rockefeller center in 1932 and it was destroyed by Nelson Rockefeller in 1934<sup><small>1</small></sup>. However, "Cradle Will Rock" was only developed by Blitzstein was from 1936 to 1937. But in the film, these events seemed to be happening simultaneously, however in reality there was a 2 year gap between them. I thought about why Robbins might have decided to put two unrelated events in the same time gap for his film. I think it's because he want to emphasized that the reason the FTP was shut down was because they were infiltrated by communists. This very idea was represented by Hazel Huffman, whom in the film decides to speak in front of congress to inform that the FTP was full of communist ideals. Furthermore, this idea is again symbolized in the film, as in the final bits of the film Tommy Crickshaw starts to perform with his puppet and declares that while his puppet is "doing the work(act)", Tommy is the one gaining all the money. Along with Crickshaw saying "Comrade" and "Dummies, Rise up!", and the scene following that where it depicts the FTP - as the dummy - being held a funeral, it is obvious Robbins trying to say that the FTP was to radical, and hence the reason they closed.
	As Robbins was trying to create an enjoyable film he clearly chose to modified the characters and their action in the play. For example, while the Venice theatre, the film displayed the actors moving around in the theatre. However, in reality "members of the WPA, seated in the audience, sang their parts" as they allowed them to say they "technically not violating an order from Frank Gillmore, president of Actors Equity Association, against taking part in an unauthorized presentation of the Federal opera". In addition, to Marc Blitzstein's schizophrenia-like tendencies and the mentioning of Mussolini (plus the hatred towards Italians), this movie was really confusing. Not going to lie, you need a lot of background information to understand everything it has to offer. I would not recommend the film unless you have the time.

	The clips from the film I would recommend to the class would be 1) from 8:35 to 9:30 and 2) 30:35 to 32: 40. The two clips depict Olive Stanton trying to get a time while being surrounded by a large line of people behind her. The clips would emphasize how man people wanted jobs during the Great Depression. For further learning, I would recommend watching this short documentary on youtube to see how violent the memorial day massacre was: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3RUGLfFv0.">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3RUGLfFv0.</a>
