Suburbia, was without question the home of white people. Middle class wealthy white people. Thus, without any question, the media images failed to capture the lives of the 50 million African American and other races. These images are the incomplete version of America. They are also distorted because the ads only tried to show the perfect lives of the suburbs.
</p>

<p>
The PADADOX of this affluence was that despite many African Americans redefining the modern culture, most African Americans were not able to share this wealth. Instead they were "invisible"to the media.
</p>

<p>
Ralph Ellison defines invisibility as the act of refusing to see someone. Although, Ellison made it so it was the problem of America, this obviously applies to black Americans because the media refused to put most in good light. Like O'Meally suggsts, unlike today, back in the 50s there was no sight of the invisible ones.
</p>

<p>
A system like Jim Crow could thrive in the US because there was laws that empowered the bullies. In addition, the people who were in charge of making sure that the rules were followed were the bullies. There is also the fact that there was an embedded feeling of racism in America.
</p>

<p>
The Great Migration gave African American opportunities...in the north. But in the south, there was still visible racism, and the customs were different in comparison. The people born from the great migration and never went south did not really understand this. For example, in north there was some interaction that was allowed between black and white Americans, yet in the south there was absolutely no way a black man could talk to a black women. Emmet did not know that he had to say "yes sir, no sir"and other customs like this.
</p>

<p>
The news of Emmet Till's gruesome death spread and the feelings of his mother led people to know about the unfairness Black Americans went through in the South. It shock and frightened people that this could happen to anyone. They wanted justice for this southern racism.
</p>

<p>
What is so important about the fact that most black Americans were one generation removed from the South is that during that time the average time for a generation was 19 years. Meaning that the people who committed injustices are still alive and are probably the ones in charge. In addition, it meant that these black Americans had some form of family in the south - family members who were in danger.
</p>

<p>
I think the leader of the modern Civil Rights Movement uses what's happening in the world to show that there is still injustices. For example, the charlottesville accident was all over the twitter and many leaders used it show that the kkk was still very much alive. Thanks to this, I think the influence they had increased. Thus, they could further their aims to say they can say their efforts are needed.

Elizabeth Eckford was the pivot to allowing mixed race school. Her walk was the resistance that allowed that to happen. Honestly, this was not the first time I watched this scene - it's too important for 8th grade history. However, this time thanks to the background of Emmet Till, I understood it was a huge win to the black community. Thus, it made me very proud of this victory. But I understood that it was the work of many years built on top of the deaths of many. Additionally, as a mixed person and a student, I kinda relate because I like school. I'm not sure if I would have enough courage to do the same as Eckford but I would like to think I would take any risk to get a higher education.

<p>
The significance of President Esinhower's decision to send the US military to Little Rock illustrated many things. For example, the fact that the president had to follow the judicial's ruling. More significant is that it meant that the government was indirectly supporting the civil rights movement. Meaning that years of protesting was working.

I can definitely relate to the feeling of invisible. Especially in stuy. Like I know race is not supposed to matter but at this point I cannot deny that I am a minority at Stuy. Although I am very outgoing person, there are times where I feel secluded in stuy because I can't understand some things. I like to stuy, but my parents would not really pay for external lessons. This isn't my parents not loving me, but I difference in culture. For instance they would, however, support me to get a job and live by myself. For me getting a job and having experience is equal to studying. It sounds weird, but I don't see anything wrong with what my parents teach me as to me studying and getting a job are equally important.
</p>

<p>
Despite the differences at Stuy, I thought I would be ok. However, personally, there was a time where I felt I was truly invisible. In my sophomore year, a classmate posted a link to a survey from the spectator. The first question it asked was "what is your ethnically/race" and I as I always do I looked for latino/hispanic...expect the option wasn't there. Nada. Not even other :(. So I sat there for a second, until I realized that the maker of the form probably Latinos existed in stuy. I was pissed. I remember now, I posted a message in the groupchat where the link where I demanded to know where Latinos was and if there was a mistake. I have never been ashamed to be Latino, but I remember being so embarrassed when I asked this. It was like I didn't exist. I think this is the invisibility Ellison was talking about.
