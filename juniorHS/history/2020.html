Honestly, I thought 2020 was going to be defined by Coved-19. However, s seen by the recent events, we know that is not true. Time flies by and multiple events can happen at once. Before, reading a textbook or learning history from a history, I could not understand how much was happening as I am living.

Police brutality is everywhere. Hong Kong for instance, where we see people want some freedom, but the police (government in this case) are preventing that. However, I think that overall, there is something fundamentally different from the current issue in America. I think the reason for that is that racism - the thing that honestly sparks this brutality - has been embedded in America. Thus, for 400 years, Black Americans have suffering. And today they are suffering from unfair injustices. I read the article you link, and I am happy that there are some that are protesting for George Floyd, but until I see the majority of policemen marching I am going to keep believing that nothing has change.

To the looting part - yes it's bad, but I think people are trying to express their anger towards the whole situation. At the end of day, Target is going to recover, but Floyd won't.

<p>
I can't keep pretending that this is fair. I am angered that this is happening, and we should do something. COVID has really expressed how flawed our system is.
