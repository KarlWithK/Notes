Write (and when I say, "write" I mean write well: full sentences, supported ideas, examples - you can never have to much practice writing, editing, and writing) about the historical, social, and/or political back story that isn't seen in the image but NEEDS to be understood by the student of history to appreciate the importance of the image.

Image 10:
1964 was the year where President Johnson was elected and his goal was to make American for everyone. In his war against poverty, he help advocate civil rights. On July 2, the Civil Right Act of 1964,was elected. This event was referenced in image 10 of the gallery. The act was there to make sure that there the government could enforce "nondiscrimination in housing and public accommodations". There was progress. Yet earlier in the year, on June 21, there was the event known as the Freedom Summer murders, where 3 civil right leaders disappeared. The fact that the Martin Luther king Jr. was there as a guest symbolized the fact the Johnson wanted to help to support the civil rights movement and acknowledge what dangers the civil rights leaders were going through. In addition, the fact that Johnson gave one of his pens that he used to sign the Civil Rights Act to Martin Luther King Jr suggest that Johnson is fully aware of what African Americans suffered to get to this point. The pen represented that the civil rights movement were the reason that the bill was created, and, thus, they should owe a bit of the thing the bill possible. The image and bill represented all the work the civil rights movement wanted: a recognition of the unfairness and racism in America. The bill was a start to cleanse that unfairness and racism in America. And, surely, soon after there was an immediate change.
