Aim: What is SO WHAT about 1968?
</p>


<p>
The old left would have been the people demanding change during the great depression, but the new left would have been the activism during the 1960s. Free speech
</p>

<p>
Older than the baby boomers. Serious students.
</p>

<p>
Mario savio. Very passionate - anti machine.
</p>

<p>
Yippes were all about chaos and heather - later part of 1960s. Counter culture in style.
</p>


<p>
Supreme court cases. You can do anything with your body.
</p>

<p>
Yippes stand case youth international political party. More nudes. Pig for president and attack the police.
</p>

<p>
McCarthy ran as a anti-war. Johnson drop out in march.
</p>

<p>
1964 was johnson's win, but 1968 he did not.
</p>

<p>
April MLK gets assignation.
</p>

<p>
Robert F K gets killed too. Popular with young people. anti-war
</p>

<p>
Chicago not allowed some protesters. Chicago 10-8 :/.
</p>

<p>
Bobby was gagged.
</p>

<p>
Nixon enters and beats ronald regan. .7 % wins. Not a landslide. Watergate and his lack of power. Nixon. wins.
</p>

<p>
I found myself thinking about three main things. The first thing was about Nixon and how he won the popular vote  by just .7% I think you said. Either way, he was anxious his position wasn't stable and he resorted to being corrupt. This reminds me of the 2016 electron result, and although I have no solid proof, there is suggestion that Trump does not berate his supports so he still gets his support. The second thing I thought about was the Chicago Democratic election, the yippes and the police. I liked how Mr. Daly said that the police was there to preserve disorder, and as such this whole group just reminds me of the current ideas of police brutality. It's kinda funny, how many people think that many years later there are still many that disagree with police. I think many of us are still anti-war like the yippies were. Finally, I thought about Mario Savio and his machine speech. Honestly, I did not understand his speech, but I could feel the pain. At least, I understand that he was frustrated against someone, and that they should stop this heartless machine.
