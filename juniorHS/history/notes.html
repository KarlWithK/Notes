After attending the lecture or watching the posted video, reflect on at least two aspects that resonated with you, either from history or with more contemporary leadership. To receive full credit you must refer to at least two (2) specific historical details from the lecture. In addition, make at least one (1) connection to subsequent administrations (from Reagan through Trump) with specific example. Cite your source(s). Select 'turn in.

The main point that I have received throughout this week and the previous week was that Nixon was really insecure about his presidency. I mean back when Nixon won the election in 1968, he won by such a margin that he really stressed him out. In addition, he hated the media due to his personality. So, when you told us about Watergate, it really clicked to me that was something Nixon would do. He does seem like the kinda of person who would wire tap everyone. However, at the same time because he had these recordings, it would back fire on him when the judicial branch asked for those recordings. They told Nixon that the recordings could be used as evidence, and as such could be used against him. This reminds me to current time with Trump's tweet. As the SCOTUS ruled that Trump's tweet could be viewed as official statement. Obviously, these could be against him. However, what really spoke to me was that both Nixon and Trump were really insecure that the latter ignore questions that might fact check him. The video that was played at the start demonstrates their relationship as Trump was going to listening to Nixon first. The video displayed Nixon as Trump's devil and Lincoln as the moral standard. However, since Nixon was the first ghost it might suggest that the video creators think they are too people too similar.

The other thing that really reminded of Trump's administration and Nixon's Watergate scandal was that the person giving the info to the pentagon papers was close to him. Mark Felt was second top executive in the FBI, but he still decided to help Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein receive information. This is similar to the whistle blower from 2019 who exposed Trump's connection to Ukraine's leaders and other countries to spread rumors on Joe Biden. Both had to be close (in status) to trump, and ultimately they were able to damage the President's reputation.
