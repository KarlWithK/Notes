150 Americans were kidnapped and Carter seemed weak.
Jody foster. Regan got shot and his first hour was a stunt.

Digital watch, but the technology was not that impressive. Honey, I'm checking my message. The walk, stereo onset with headphones. Mobile location. Walkman. Transistor late 1940s. Sony was the brand that matter. Sony walk was a pleasure to old. Mix tape. For adults the VCR. Christmas gift. Time shifting. Super expensive. Set the time to record a show. Sue them to not record lmao.

File recording is legal. 5-4. Violates no copy rights. Movie nuts. Now you can see any time any video. Cam recorders. Make your own movie.

People seem to think that there is unstable economy, but it will recover.Stock exchange thanks to Regan.

Yuppie, now everyone is super happy about the new economy and Trump. What the world could be and should be? First golf 1980s iraqs invaded some country(?). 2008, 2011. 2003.

war world 2. Leadership. Bush 90% approval war -&gt; why didn't he get reelected. In a reception, and competition.

The Stuy 'shout-out' (out of two) was Clarissa Bushman who was a social studies who passed away two years ago. She was in wall street in the 1980s - one of the few women in there. She used to say shit, but in French to you. The second shout out was from Gill Troy, who was the head camp counselor at your camp.

Honestly, what resonated about me the most was the technology segment because you can see it was the start of the home media. As a person, I have always not been a history person. I can talk about and learn about the past history, but I would never call myself a history person. However, for some reason, I feel like if there was a class of learning about the technology Humans have gone through and how they would affected human life I would sign up immediately. Something about learning about technology just makes my mind spark up. It served as my connector for this lesson. Learning about how people were using a cassette player - VCR and how the media tried to sued the manufacturer because of "copyrights laws". However, the media ended up failing! Instead more than ever the movie industries grew up more than ever. It's how amazing how the world (in terms of our free time) because of one invention! I read a book and how different beverages represented a term of status in the world. Or how a beverage defined an age. I feel like there should be a class for this, and at the end of the semester you should research about a item that you think changed the world. I think what was absent from this lesson was kids' testaments defining how the world was like. We only had adults.

One more thing, I found interesting was that everyone loved Regan - from his first hour into his presidency, his appearance into the stock market, his actions. Everything. He was loved. It's also funny how Trump says it's not about ego. He hasn't changed. It also interesting to note Trump might get reelected with such a high employment, but Bush didn't.
Btw I love how you forge passes to go to the convention and sold them to get into the history.

The confessional 'naughtiness' was you talking about making (forging) delegate passes for the Democratic National Convection of 1992 in New York for your self and your friends. You also sold some passes which is how you made $300, and your parents didn't know anything about it.

What was the confessional 'naughtiness' described? (And by the way, we earned about $300.)
