A. Check-in question: what is Andrew Yang's latest initiative? What do you think about it?
Andrew Yang allow with his Humanity Forward program is doing a new experiment about Universal Basic Income. They(he) plan to give \(500 to 20 NYCers for five years \)500 dollars. However, while I do think it's a good idea, I think that since there is only going to be 20 of them it will be easy for the media to harass them. And/or the 20 people might feel like they owe Yang money, which might defeat the purpose of the experiment. I am not sure it really is weird.
B. What is the reasoning that birth control should be legal?
	The reason that birth control should be legal is because the constitution fundamentally offers a right of one's privacy and the protection of it. Thus police could not search for a married couple's use of contraceptions. This essentially meant that it was a couple's right to choose to use birth control or not since police could not search for it nor could they do anything about it. This was later extended to single women and men. 
C. How would you describe Justice Black's interpretation of the Constitution?
Justice Black overall thought that since the right to privacy is nowhere explicitly stated in the Constitution, that it should not be protected. He only supports what is written. While I do agree that the right to privacy was almost nowhere to be found, I think it's overall a silly interpretation. This is because 1) the constitution was made to be changed - so even if it's not there they can add it. 2) Plenty of people in the past took liberty to see interpret things in the constitution that weren't exactly said - like a national bank. It's just seems to me like an old man that was afraid to change. Still I was a bit confused because the article in step 2 it stated that Black was in a faction that focused on "expanding property rights and individual liberties". Thus, the fact that he supported more rights but not privacy confused me.
D. How do you think Griswold will establish PRECEDENT for cases concerning laws about birth control, abortion, and "sodomy?"
Griswold establish an idea that people have a right to privacy - well only married couples at the start. From there, it was clear that people had a right to control their body and property, however, they wanted. This opened up a opportunity for cases and thus was a precedent to the future laws about people's rights because it gave reasoning that police could not arrest someone for having anal sex (gay couples), nor could they search for use of birth control. In case police did arrest someone for acting on these behaviors, then the defendant could appeal to the court to see who is right. Finally, I think that the fact that the case establish that a new right can be inferred from the Constitution meant that for something like abortion it could have a new chance even if meant "technically" killing a baby that was not alive. It was a start to rights for citizens that were not so obvious.

E. Hypothesize and answer the aim.
So I think the aim question is asking: "how did the Warren Court split American ideals more?" And to that I think that it's quite simple - the Warren's Court was too liberal, and thus people who could not agree could definitely not see eye to eye after these rulings that were one way. For example, the right to privacy was a new right that was inferred from the Constitution not stated by it. Thus, some could agree to the new right, but others could not because it meant creating new variables into the equation. They were too wild and brought a lot of rights, many which were controversial, and thus, people were divided on ideals.
