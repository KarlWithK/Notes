<p>
Step 1: I would like you to conduct some research and find a rock 'n roll song(s) from the 1950s, 1960s, or early 1970s. 
</p>

<p>
Find a song(s) that can be interpreted or has a clear connection to the history we have been studying. Consider the topics of civil rights, student activism, the Vietnam War, the women's movement, the gay rights movement, politics for a start.
</p>

<p>
Step 2: Thoughtfully and clearly respond to the posted question. Refer to the specific history (detail is key). Please visually separate your ideas and write your best. Cite your sources (you don't have to site lyrics.com nor do you need to share a performance of the song). I wrote curriculum for a fantastic resource that links history to music so it will be clear to me if your submission is not your's.
</p>

<p>
Step 3: Select 'Turn In.'
</p>

<p>
Rock 'n roll song'
</p>


<p>
What is the connection between your selected song/ songs and US or global history? Provide at least 3 specific examples. 
</p>


<p>
I picked the song 'The beat goes on' by Sonny and Cher because of its sick beat and its obvious implications and references it has to the history we were studying. (<a href="https://youtu.be/bS3O5zg290k)">https://youtu.be/bS3O5zg290k)</a>
</p>

<p>
The first thing that caught my eye was the reference to teenagers' life changing - or at least the culture. In this class we have been learning how teenagers (youths) are now focusing on going out with their friends, and when this song came it out the now-baby-boomers had to be about in their late teens or early twenties. In the song it states, "Charleston was once the rage, uh huh, History has turned the page, uh huh". Here we see that the popular culture is changing depending on the music. However, I think what is important here is "history has change" because the 1960s was a time of change brought by the new left. This song indirectly acknowledges that the youth is changing America's trends.
</p>

<p>
The next thing that it reference and was more obvious was in the line "and Men still keep on marching off to war". Of course this is refereeing to the Vietnam war, which was occurring at the time of the song's release. The whole feeling of this song, however, is that life just goes on even when there is problems. Thus, when Sonny &amp; Cher mention the war, they are trying that it is unfair towards to the men. The next line reinforces this ideal as the singers mention "Electrically they keep a baseball score". Which means they have to watch the game from somewhere else or listen to how the baseball games go. This is because, even though they were Americans, they could not watch the games if they were stuck somewhere else.
</p>

<p>
Finally, the last part of the song address that not everyone is doing well in America. Sunny &amp; Cher sing, "Bums still cries, 'Hey buddy, Have you got a dime?'". I had to search what Bums meant (<a href="https://www.wordnik.com/words/bum)">https://www.wordnik.com/words/bum)</a> and basically they are 'shiftless' people, meaning one without a job. So when the singers state that a jobless person is <span id="-stil"></span><strong id="stil">stil</strong> asking for money, it means our economy might be going south. Perhaps, the singers wanted to illustrate that even though in the media everyone is happy, there is still those "invisible" folks living with us that are struggling.
