Why you shouldn't do this:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Java is the definition of a object oriented language. You will have to navigate through huge code bases, have tests and go to implementations. If you want to change something, you will probably have to go through multiple files. Yes it's possible to do this in vim, but it will still not be as good. Java Wants an IDE.

<li>
If you are going this way make sure to learn how to use a build engine (tool). You don't to compile classes over and over again.

Hi, it's me again (under another username). It's my second video and thought it was better than the first. Anyway, I want to apologize because despite the fact that it's my second video, it's still not as good as I would like it to be. Unfortunately, I have a lot of work, and I wanted to just finish this video. I hope you guys can enjoy. I know I made it it and all, but I think it's an ok video that can help people. In the video's description there will be a pinned comment detailing everything.
