<p>
General Keybinds:
[ windows ]
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Win+e to open the file broswer

<li>
win + period for emoji ** very important

<li>
win + l for lock screen

<li>
Win+ d hide your desktop

<li>
You should ask check out virtual desktops

</ul>

<p>
[ linux ] - there isn't really a set of keyboard shortcuts since you can use can rebind them, but...
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Ctrl-Alt-F1 for a tty

<li>
Ctrl-Alt-F7 to go back to x or a gui

</ul>

<p>
Some personal tips/ keybinds:
[ firefox ]
</p>
<ul>
<li>
F6 to focus to url bar (same as C-l)

<li>
C-J for focus to search bar

</ul>

<p>
[ ssh ]
</p>
<ul>
<li>
This might not apply to seniors who don't have to ssh into homer, but you can add your ssh key to one of our servers to auto connect with ssh-copy-id. No more password!

</ul>

<p>
[ bash/zsh ] - this might not work on dash or fish.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Ctrl-R -&gt; search through your history

<li>
!! to reuse the previous command for the current command.

<li>
cd - to go back to the previous directory.

</ul>

<p>
auto cd - I often find myself moving through a lot of directories. And it's really a a pain to write cd all the time (yes i'm lazy). To get rid of this. Use AUTOCD
</p>
<ul>
<li>
bash - set in your bashrc <code>shopt -s autocd</code>

<li>
zsh - <code>setopt AUTOCD </code> 

</ul>

<p>
vi mode - by default bash/zsh come with emacs like binding. So if you use vim you might be interested in vi mode.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
bash - <code>set -o vi</code>

<li>
zsh - <code>bindkey -v</code>

</ul>

<p>
Now if you do use vi mode then you can use <code>&lt;Esc&gt;v</code> to write your command(s) in a vim buffer. Quit and the command should run.
</p>

<p>
[ ctags ]
If you are writing c or any language then I recommend using tags. I personally use universal ctags. Tags allow my to go through my code very easily. Its like the "Go to definiton" many IDEs have.
</p>
<ul>
<li>

</ul>

<p>
[ git ]
gitignore - Everyone here should know about .gitignore - you are kinda required to use it for any project. But did you know that you can have a global gitignore? Just edit your .gitconfig and under [core] add excludesfile = $SomeDir. For example I have it in my .config/git as so
<code>excludesfile = /home/karl/.config/git/gitignore_global</code>. A global gitignore is really useful for things you never want to upload to your master / version conrol host. For example, I have git always ignore .class for java, tag files and for javascript folks I have node_modules/ to never, never, never have to worry about uploading 1000 MBs of files or more.
</p>

<p>
tools - You can make custom tools for git. For example I currently use vim's diff to see any changes in my current git repo:
</p>
<pre>
[diff]
	tool = nvimdiff
[difftool "nvimdiff"]
	cmd = nvim -d $LOCAL $REMOTE
</pre>
<ul>
<li>
Now everytime I run git diff it uses vim to show the changes. You can use use this for merge tools

</ul>

<p>
git hooks - Say you want a script to run a change happens in your repo. You can use git hooks to do that. I currently use it to regenerate tags for my repo when I new file is added.
</p>

<p>
[ vim ]
Two things that have change my life...well 4 things.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
g; and g, to go foward and backwards your change list

<li>
]m and [m to go foward and backwards your methods.

</ul>
