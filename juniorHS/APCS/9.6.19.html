CS Tojo: bit.by/stooge Due 9/15
</p>

<p>
Aim: introduction into computer system (1.0)
</p>

<p>
A computer system consist of hardware and software.
	Ex:
		Hardware: Monitors, Mouse and Keyboards
</p>

<p>
		Software: Windows and data files
</p>

<p>
	Key Hardware components:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Central processing unit (CPU)

<li>
Input/Output (i/O) Devices

<li>
Main Memory: storage device the holds the program while the
			CPU  executes it (RAM)

<li>
Secondary memory devices Physical devices
		 that can hold data for long periods

</ul>


<p>
			CPU &lt;-&gt; Monitors
			-&gt;Main memory &lt;-&gt; Hard disk
</p>

<p>
	Software Categories
</p>

<p>
	Operating system (OS)
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Provides a user interface.

<li>
Manages computer resources such as the CPU, memory, programs,
		and hardware device communications

</ul>

<p>
	Application: A term for any software other an OS.
</p>

<p>
	Graphical User Interface (GUI): Is any interface that is simplified using				graphics
</p>

<p>
		Ex: windows - distinct work areas, icons, buttons.
</p>

<p>
			Non-GUI: Dos operating system, Terminal
</p>

<p>
	Digital vs Analog
</p>

<p>
		Analog: continuous information
		Digital: Information in pieces
</p>


<p>
	Sound is stored digitally by taking samples at constant intervals:
		Called sampling devise
</p>


<p>
	All information is devitalized. Ex: Text - Unicode
</p>

<p>
	The way a computer stores these 'numbers' is in binary. A digital signal will have two extremes,"high" (1) and "low" (0).
</p>

<p>
		binary notation has only two possible values, 1 and 0, which are represented by bits.
</p>

<p>
		A bit basically represents "on" or "off".
</p>

<p>
	A byte, is 8 bits together, allowing 2^8 different permutations.
</p>

<p>
	A megabyte, is about 1 Million bytes.
</p>

<p>
	A gigabyte, is about 1 thousand megabytes.
</p>


<p>
Binary numbers: Represents numbers in either 1 or 0.
