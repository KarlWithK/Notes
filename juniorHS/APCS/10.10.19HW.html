What is an algorithm? What is pseudo code?
</p>

<p>
An algorithm is a step-by-step process for solving a problem. A recipe is like an algorithm.
</p>

<p>
An algorithm is often described using pseudo code, which is a mixture of code
statements and English phrases. Pseudo code provides enough structure
to show how the code will operate without getting bogged down in the An algorithm is a step-by-step
syntactic details of a particular programming language and without process for solving a problem,
being prematurely constrained by the characteristics of particular pro- often expressed in
pseudo code.
