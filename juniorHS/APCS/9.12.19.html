<p>
Aim: Storing integers using various binary notation.
</p>

<p>
Binary addition is done from right to left.
</p>

<p>
Fractions in binary.
</p>

<p>
	Left of the decimal point.
</p>

<p>
		Example: 101.101
			-&gt;one half, one fourth and one eighth. Decreasing. Powers of two.
</p>

<p>
	Line the decimal point up.
</p>

<p>
	10.011
	100.11
	111.001 = 3 + 2 + 1 + 1/8 = 7 1/8
</p>


<p>
Excess notation:
</p>

<p>
	Bit to the left represents the sign
	Examples: 1111 = 7, 1001 = 1, 1000 = 0, 0001 = -7, 0000 = -8
	You can subtract 8 to every number.
</p>

<p>
	Bad because 1010
</p>
<blockquote>
+ 0110
</blockquote>
<p>
		= 0000 but this equals -8.
</p>


<p>
Two's complement notation:
</p>

<p>
	Left bit determines which sign it is. All positive have zero as left bit as 0 while negative have 1. Then subtract by 2^bit.
		Or you can have thee the negative number and read the complement and add 1 to it.
		Example: you can do 1100 (-4) and its complement 0011 (3) and add one to it which makes it 0100 (4)
</p>

<p>
	Only a limited amount of numbers.
</p>
