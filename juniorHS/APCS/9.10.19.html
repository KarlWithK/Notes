Man memory and secondary memory:
</p>

<p>
	Main memory is made up of many consecutive locations, called cells.
</p>

<p>
	A cell can be referenced, accessed, and modified inf ideally. A memory 
wit a low address is just as accessible as a high address. Memory can be processed in any order, or random accessed. 
</p>

<p>
	Storage capacity is the number of bytes it can hold. Units of storage in powers of two.
</p>

<p>
	Bit 1 b 1/8 of a byte
	Byte 1B 2^0 = 1
	Megabyte GB 2^30 - 1, 073, 741, 824
	Terabyte TB 2^40 = 1, 099, 511, 627, 776
</p>

<p>
	Main memory is also called RAM (random access memory). Larger RAM allows a computer to retrieve information from secondary memory less frequently.
</p>

<p>
 	HT &lt;-&gt; Slow Transfer {MAIN MEMORY} Faster Transfer &lt;-&gt; CPU
</p>

<p>
	Main memory is considered volatile, because the information will be lost when there is lost in power. Secondary memory are usually non-volatile, where the information is stilled retained where there's no power.
</p>

<p>
	Most common secondary memory are hard drives (40 to ~160+ GB), floppy disks (1.44MB), CD-R,DVD-R, memory sticks
</p>
	
<p>
	Secondary memory (Magnetic Disk):
		A hard drive consists of magnetic disks, where a bit is represented by a magnetized particle on the disk. A read/ write head passes over the spinning disk. 
</p>
		
<p>
		 A disk is divided into tracks. Tracks are divided into arcs, called sectors. The Read/Write head "floats" just above the surface. The disk spins at speeds at 3000-8000Ron. There is also a seek time for the head to find the appropriate track. High capacity disk systems consist of many platters on a common spindle.
</p>

<p>
	RAM VS ROM:
</p>

<p>
	RAM has the ability to read, write, and rewrite. ROM (Read only memory) can be read once the data is written.
	-Microchips can be ROM, embedded with instructions.
	-CD-R (700MB) are similar to magnetic disks, except they have microscopic physical pits, which when read by a laser when reflected back. Physical pits, allows mass production of Cads such as music.
	-CD-AW(700MB) use special material that is heat sensitive the same effect. Operates like a CD-R, but can be changed.
	-Dads (4.7-8.5GB) have more bits per square inch than a CD, allowing more data to be stored.
	-Magnetic &lt;tapes&gt;&lt;/tapes&gt;sun as cassettes or high-capacity backup systems, use one long strip of magnetic tape, with a read/write head and two reels.
</p>


<p>
Aim: THE CPU and the machine cycle (1.1)
	The central processing unit consists of 3 main components: the control unit, registers, and the arithmetic/logic unit.
</p>

<p>
		Main memory &lt;-&gt; Bus &lt;-&gt; CPU (Control unit, arithmetic/logic unit, registers
</p>

<p>
		Registers provide a temporary steerage of information. They can be classified as either general-purpose registers or special-purpose registers.
</p>

<p>
	Also a kind of memory called cache (might be located next to the CPU). Places to store stuff. La &gt; la &gt; registers. Communication needs to be fast. Less time to look at things.
</p>

<p>
	Cache depends on different kinds of address locality to be efficient. Spatial locality: consecutive cell addresses are more likely to be addressed. Temporal locality: recent addresses will be accessed.
</p>

<p>
	The control unit coordinates the transfer of data between main memory and the registers It also tells the arithmetic unit to prefer operations on data in the (?).
</p>

<p>
	Arithmetic logic unit (ALOE):
		The arithmetic/logic unit performs calculations and makes decisions.
</p>

<p>
	The machine cycle:
</p>

<p>
	The control unit performs its job by continually repeating an algorithm, that consists of three stews: Fetch, decode, and execute.
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Retrieve the next instruction( via program counter), and then increment the program counter.

</ol>


<p>
	Processing speed:
		The system clock generates pulses at regular intervals, and this rate is called the clock speed. 950MHZ, translates to ~950 million pulses our second. The speed if the clock roughly measures how a CPU is.
</p>

<p>
	Larger instruction set (ex. 64 bits), larger cache, pipe lining, parallel processing. Increase speed.
