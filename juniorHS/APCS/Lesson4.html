Aim: searching through Arrays(6.2)
</p>

<p>
The most basic type of search is a linear search or sequential search. Starting at the first element, we look at each element until the very last, we look at each element until the very last, or til we find what we're looking for.
</p>

<p>
What is the best case scenario for this type of search? What is the worst case?
</p>

<pre java>
	public static int seqSearch(int[] num, int key) {
		for (int x = 0; x &lt; num.length; x++)
			if (key == num[x])
				return x;
		return -1;
	}
</pre>

<p>
How would you look up a page # in a book? Your method is a binary search. If the data is arranged in order (low to high), then we can start searching at the middle element.
</p>

<table>
<tr>
<td>
Maximum # of comparisons = Log<sub><small>2</small></sub>N + 1
</td>
</tr>
</table>

Aim: Sorting Arrays (6.3)
</p>

<p>
<em>Sorting</em> is simply arranging a list of items in order.
</p>

<p>
Selection sort
Putting items into their final, sorted positions, is the <em>selection sort algorithm</em>.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Scan the list and find the smallest value.

<li>
Swap the value with the first position.

<li>
Repeat on the remaining set of items.

</ol>

<p>
Insertion sort ( start with two items )
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Compare a new item with all items in the all items in the new list, from right to left, shifting all greater items to its right.

<li>
Create an empty slot, and insert the new item into the open slot.

<li>
Repeat on the remaining set of items.

</ol>
