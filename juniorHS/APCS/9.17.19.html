Gates are smart. Learn about them if you want. We can everything with AND or just NOR.

<p>
A flip flop circuit, is a special type of circuit that HS one of two output values; its output remains fixed until a temporary pulse from another circuit causes it to shift values.

Programming Paradigms, The evolution of languages was not a liner path, rather it has branched out into different approaches, paradigms.
</p>


<p>
Imperative: Machine languages, FORTRAN, COBOL, BASIC, Pascal, C, Ada
Declarative: GPS, Prolong
Functional: ML, Lisp, Scheme
Object-oriented: Simile, C++, Java, Ada 95

<p>
Aim: introduction to object-oriented concepts: AN object is defined by a class in the java programming language. A class can be thought defined data dupes that contains different properties and actions you can do.
</p>

<p>
Each one has data related to its and it is self contained - encapsulation. Classes should be designed to have common features as high in the hierarchy as possible. EX; Animals could be splat into reptiles, Bird and birds, mammals, and different kinds of mammals. Inheritance would allow its children to have the same properties. Subclass. Reuse code if the code is followed welled.
</p>

<p>
Polymorphic Means many forms. When relating this to an object, it means we can have a class represent many different forms depending on how it is being used,
</p>

<p>
Animals can call "move" but can change it.
