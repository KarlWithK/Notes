<p>
A class is a blueprint of an object. It has no memory space for data. Each instance of an object has its own data space and its state.
</p>

<p>
A class can have both data fields that defines an object, and methods that will operate the data, thus changing the state of the data.
</p>


<p>
No public static void main ... Because it's not meant to output anything.
</p>

<p>
Private - protect the variable. Only visible within the file.
</p>

<p>
public Coin () - making a function.
</p>

<p>
"Coin x;" just creates an object which is equal to null.
</p>

<p>
new will create memory to make a Coin object: HEADS, TAILS, Face.
</p>

<p>
"Coin x = new Coin(); #will create a constructor"
</p>
<pre java>
public void flip () {
	face = (int) (Math.random() * 2) //Will assign zero or one.
	Math.random = numb.next Double();
}
</pre>

<p>
can call method like flip() because flip is public while face is private.
</p>

<p>
Cannot call private.
</p>

<p>
public *<span id="-datatype"></span><strong id="datatype">datatype</strong>* shads();
</p>

<p>
example public Boolean shads(); **must have a return file.
</p>
<pre java>
public String to String() {
	string Face Name;

	if (face == HEADS)
		face Name = "Heads";
	else
		face Name = "Tails";

	return face Name
}
</pre>
<p>
Instance data refers the variables declared at class level is accessible by all class methods. Tea variables in a method are only accessible within that method.
</p>

<p>
If it has a main method then you can run java on it.
</p>

<p>
coin int face = 1.
</p>

<p>
Encapsulating refers to an object's ability to be self-covering. All the data is held within and should only be accesses through a well-defined interface. This interface are the methods.
</p>

<p>
public lasts outside programs have access to the method (or variable). Private denies access from anything outside of the class.
</p>

<p>
public methods for client, does not protect data, but private does and supports other classes.
