Part 1 -- The Warning Signs of Cancer
</p>

<ol>
<li>
The warning signs of cancer are exemplified by the acronym "CAUTIONS". Can you match a type of cancer to it's physical manifestation?

</ol>
<p>
1a. If possible, can you name a different disease that might have a similar warning sign?
</p>

<p>
C. A change in bowel or bladder habits
A. A sore that does not heal
U. Unusual bleeding or discharge
T. Thickening or lump
I Indigestion or difficulty swallowing
O. Obvious change in wart or mole
N. Nagging cough or hoarseness
S. Sudden weight loss
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Why would sudden weight gain not be a warning sign of cancer?

</ol>


<p>
Part 2 -- How Stress Affects Us.
</p>

<p>
A stressor is a challenge that may be positive or negative. Either way, it triggers the stress response. The perception of stress is subjective. Not all people experience stress in the same way or to the same degree. The intensity of stress is sometimes learned from people around us as we observe how they handle challenges in their life. Some types of stress come from our external environment while other types are more internal -- they lie deep within our personality.
</p>

<p>
Positive stress is called 'eustress'. It is the anticipation, exhilaration and excitement one feels when faced with a positive event such as graduation, getting a driver's license, playing a championship game or taking an overseas trip. Negative stress is known as 'distress'. Distress is triggered by challenges that are overwhelming and may have a negative outcome such as the death of a loved one or a divorce.
</p>

<p>
Human beings cannot live without some degree of stress. Stress motivates us and acts as the driving force to move forward.
</p>

<p>
It is very important to place stress into the proper perspective. Sometimes we get too caught up with daily hassles that are not worth our time or energy. Hence, the comments 'Don't sweat the small stuff' or 'Roll with the punches'.

Answer in your own words in complete sentences. Take your time to think about the answers. Don't rush through them.
</p>

<ol>
<li>

</ol>
<p>
3.. Discuss the positive and negative stressors that have had an impact on your life since school closed in March.
4.. How does this present stress differ from the stress caused by arguing with parents or peers or not having enough money?
5.. Has assessing your popularity on social media ever contributed to you stress? Explain
</p>
<ol>
<li>
. Stress occurs throughout life. For each stage, identify one stressor that is age related.

</ol>
<p>
a. infancy to two years old
b. ages 6 to 11
c. ages 12 to 17
d. ages 18 to 25
e. ages 25 to 60
f. ages 60 and up
</p>

<p>
7.. Is there ever a point in time when eustress or distress does not play a part in one's life?
</p>

<p>
Part 1
You can match a cancer to it's physical manifestation. Fr instance a change in bowel is linked to prostate or colon cancer. A sore does not heal can be linked to skin cancer, U for cervical/ovarian cancer, T for breast cancer, I can perhaps be throat cancer, O can also be skin cancer, N can be lung cancer, sudden weight loss (S) can be any cancer. However, some of these symptoms can be some other disease. For instance, U or unusual bleeding or discharge can be an STD like chlamydia, N (nagging cough ) can be bronchitis.
</p>

<p>
Suddens weight gain means that you are getting too much nutrients, thus it can't be a sign of cancer. This is because cancer is the rapid growth of cells, which means they would need more nutrients to survive.
</p>

<p>
Part 2
I think many teens who check for Testicular or Breast Cancer are probably distressed about their body. The fact is if you find any sort of lump in your body, I would be worried about your health. I don't think it's uncommon for a person to have family history with cancer, thus finding a lump would stress anyone out since it would mean going to the doctor's. Also, since teens care about their bodies too much, then possibly they are stressed about body image.
</p>

<p>
If you have cancer, there is always a chance you can die. Not just cancer, but any serious disease that doesn't have a cure. Thus, the knowledge that you have a disease that might kill you and you can't do anything about it might cause a person to be depressed about their current life.
</p>

<p>
Honestly, the only 'eustress' that I could think about is the fact that summer is almost here. However, there so much more 'distress' in my life ever since we started to do online learning. For instance, I have to worry about school and the fact that I can't really be behind my work since there is so much. These stress ors have really impacted me, but I am trying to take control of my life.
</p>

<p>
The present stress differers from an argument with my parents because I can't know who is going to contact Covid, and if they are going to be ok. I think the main difference is that there is a level of uncertainty and I can't control it. This is stressing me out.
</p>

<p>
I don't really have any social media. So, I can't really answer this. However, I would like to think that it does because dealing with people online is a pain - meaning that it would probably be stressful.
</p>

<p>
For a infant they are probably stress about the lack of food they have or the quality of it. For a child that is 6 to 11, they are probably stressed about their friends and how they can become cooler. For teens, 12 to 17, they are probably wondering about their school lives and how it will impact them. For young adults, 18 to 25, they are probably stressed about college or/and work. They have much to do, but just started living alone. For adults, 25 to 60, they are probably worried about money and if they are happy. Finally, for the elderly, 60 and up, they are probably worried about how much time they have left to live. Everyone has their own stresses.
</p>

<p>
I think there isn't any time where they don't play a role. Since everything is just a form of expectations and with these expectations you have to response to them in some way. Thus, the expectations become stress. Stress is a part of everyone's lives.
