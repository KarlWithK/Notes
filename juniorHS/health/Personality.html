Abraham Maslow and his Hierarchy of Needs are needs that a person is required to have to make/allow one's life to be purposeful. Maslow decided that every humans has different kid of needs: physiological needs, safety needs, belongingness &amp; love needs, esteem need and self-actualization. It's a combination that you need both material needs and spiritual needs.

There are definitely scenarios were a person move downward on the hierarchy. For example, if you are on the Esteem level then you have then you have some resources to get acknowledgment. However, what if suddenly, your house burns down? You can easily not have a bed to rest; thus going down to the physical level. Personally, I think that I am not quite yet at the self actualization level because although I am using my computer science skills to help others, I haven't reached my full potential - I have a lot to learn. Thus, not yet.

Erik Erikson's theory about identity and development states that there are 8 stages that a person goes through. In addition, for each stage there are different conflict that a person goes through that defines them. In stage 1, from birth to 1 year old, you go though Trust vs Mistrust. For stage 2, you go through Autonomy vs doubt/shame. Stage 3 (2-6 years old) you go through initiative vs guilt. Then from 6 years old to 12 years old, you go though, industry vs inferiority - stage 4. Stage 5 is from 12 to 18, and you go though identity vs role confusion. Stage 6 is from 19 to 40, and it is about intimacy vs isolation. Next is stage 7, from 40 to 65 years old, which is generatively vs stagnation. Finally, stage 8 is 65 years old to age and is about ego integrity vs despair. Erik Erikson coined the phrase "identity crisis", which many of us go though.

According to Erikson, I would be in the stage 5 age group. This means I would be developing my own personal identity. Although, Erikson's theory makes sense to me, I am not sure if I can actively apply it to my own life. I feel like life is a journey, and even if I have answers and someone is like "Oh, yea. According to Erikson's it normal to feel this way" - I would not feel any better. What I am trying to say is that, identifying these stages doesn't improve my life. It's just like thanks for telling me. Personally, I feel like if a child was passive they can still be an assertive teen - it just means they are starting to realize who they want to be; they have started to form their identity.

Sigmund Freud is the father of psychoanalysis and he came up with structure of the Mild. The mild has 3 parts: Id, Ego, and the Superego. The Id part is that part that wants pleasure and is driven by the pleasure principal. Ego is the part that understands rules and in touch with reality - it helps us make Rational decisions ( reality principal ). Finally, Superego is what generates guilt that is concern with what is socially acceptable and pushes us to be ideal. There must be a balance for a healthy person to exist.

Sue's love to paint, dance, and act are all pleasure for her mind, thus her mind is dominated by Id. Karen on the other hand is driven by Ego, basically I would like to think that she driven by Ego since she is upset but still understands the rules. Gina becoming a judge shows that it is Superego because she is pushing her passion and wants be ideal. Personally, overall, I would like to think that Maslow represents me the most because it's kinda vague. I like that it is vague as it allows me to know that I can go down the pyramid, but I can also go up in it. Meaning, there is always room for change.
