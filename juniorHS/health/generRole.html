First of all, I would like to say that the ted talk you posted was really good. I certainly opened my eyes a bit as a guy.

Like any normal household, there are some things my family does that reinforce the traditional gender roles, but I think we are also different in a lot of ways. One of the things my family supports is saying I love you. Yes, I am forced to say I love you to my parents and hug my dad. I don't think you usually see men hugging a lot. And my dad just hugs me when he sees me. And I love it. In fact, personally, my dad has been a huge role model. He has definitely taught me manly stuff, but he has taught me to be caring. My dad is the kinda of man to hug and kiss all his grandkids and children. He embarrasses me sometimes, but I know he does it out of love. I think my dad is the man that Mr. Baldoni was talking about: he cares so much about my mom and takes her opinions into consideration and he helps her a lot. Additionally, he cares for my siblings and I. He has taught me a lot on how to be a loving father. He is a person who breaks the typical father stereotypes. And since he has been teaching me ever since I was a child, I think I am also able to break them. Hopefully.

Go to any restaurant and you will probably find out the chef was a male. Go to any home, and you will probably discover that the female in the households cocks. I think it's a very interesting to look at. And the more I thought about it, the more I realize that there is somehow a stereotype that most cooks at home at female, but not at restaurants. This discovery led me realize that perhaps I should learning from my sister. That was the start of how I started to cook.

Honestly, I would like to say that my household didn't fit in to the stereotype that only females cook, but 3 years ago that was entirely the case. Only my mom and sister cooked. However, there was a point where my mom got tired. And while she didn't force me to cook, I could see her expectations. And I saw that. Naturally it was one of the reasons, I wanted to cook for myself. In retrospect, I glad I decided to learn how to cook, as I think it made me prepare for the future. Now, I don't have to wait until someone serves me food. I can take it for myself.
Right now, all the men in my family can cook and in the case of an emergency we don't need anyone to help us. This is the way my household has broken the idea that only women cook.
