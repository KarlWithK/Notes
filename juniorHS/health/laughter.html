What's so funny
</blockquote>

<p>
There are some universal expressions that you will be able to recognize anywhere from. A frown on someone's face means sadness, a smile means being happy. Laughter is not an expression, but in a similar fashion it is universal. This is the case because anyone who is having a good time laughs and this action is easily recognized. It is also quite contagious.

When someone laughs you are forced to move a bit around. Meaning a laughter can make a stiff person instantly unwind. In a similar fashion, you are forced to take your mind of some task and as such laughter allows your to refresh your mind. You will be better mentally. Socially, humor or making others laugh will rise you up in popularity and in looks. After all someone who is laughing has their eyes closed and will be unable to see you. Finally, spirituality it will feel as a load was taken off you. Humor is cure to a sad moment.

Laughter is and will forever force you to move. This again forces you to take your mind off things and focus on the joke or the person making the joke. You are forced to make space for a thing that would not otherwise catch your mind. Thus, allowing you to be stress free for a moment.

This is my opinion, but I believe that a person is more interesting if they can laugh and make others laugh. In addition, if they are interesting it generally means a person is more happy with their selves. This translate to more confidence and a more positive outlook in life. People with humor can see a world I might not be able to see.

When you look back you sometimes 'cringe' at your past actions because they were so stupid. In a way it is a reflection at how much you grown. Laughing at yourself is the same thing. You realize that you have bad characteristics and you want to change that. Meaning that you recognize your faults and want to change. This is positive because you realize the opportunities you can look forward to.

"Laughter is the best medicine" means that sometimes the cure to life is laughter. There is a problem you have that you can't solve? Then don't worry about it and laugh your way to a safe place. It means to be happy and be OK with the outcome. Similar, "Don't sweat the small stuff" personifies the idea that it is OK to make mistakes and life can and will go on. It is there to state that you can't be perfect and you should move on from your faults. "Roll with the punches" also means that when things don't go your way, the only thing you can do is to adapt with the hits (punches) and move on. Finally, "Lighten up" means to not be so serious and recognize that there is a softer way at looking at things. It is often used to tell someone that they are being too harsh, and that they should chill ax and relax.

I have watched Rick and Morty for some time and it's finally getting some new episodes. It's a 'mature' show, however, because of all its gruesome scenes and its "adult" comedy. It brightens my day. The show can go anywhere and with its scifi universe it can do anything. Turning to a pickle? Replacing your dead self? Having a normal family? Checked, checked, and not checked. Rick and Morty has a weird family relationship and because chaotic family there are hilarious scenes. It's dark humor and because of this it allows me to understand why some people the way they do. It's a cartoon, but it's not meant for kids. This is why its so popular. Usually cartoons are pure and sweet, but not this one. For the reasons listed above, Rick and Morty makes me laugh as it is a very funny show that makes no attempt to pretend the world isn't full of chaos.
