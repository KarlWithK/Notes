I think this is the alarm stage - specifically the protesters are flighting and protesting the killing of black men. They are dealing with distress of knowing this is going on.

Marie is dealing with eustress - she got into to her first choice and is now excited to go there. She is in the resistance stage as she fights her urge to go wild.

<li>
Base on the description, I don't think it's possible to say, but assuming he just found out about this lump he is in stage 1. He is probably experiencing distress since cancer is a negative stress, however, he has not responded as such there is no indication of whether he will fight or run away.

<li>
Brittany is going through distress, and despite the fact that she has been struggling the whole semester she still wants to try. But she knows she will fail, therefore, she is probably in recovery since she knows her limitations, and knows that is probably won't matter. Similarly, Joe going through distress, however, base on the information provided, it seems that he, too, is in recovery, because the "tries" hints that Joe was able to take his wallet back.

<li>
Jojo is feeling distress, and she is facing an unexpected stressor. Therefore, it is probably just stage 1 stress - alarm. Furthermore, she is probably going have to fight because she already entered the classrooom.

<li>
Karen was facing distress because of her relationship. However, because she picked to run away she is probably at stage 1 after she escaped. Before, she must have been exhausted.

<li>
Eileen is facing eustress because she is excited over the outcome. In addition, because she picked to face her feelings she is fighting her embarrassment and her alarm stage stress.

<li>
Jody and her friends are facing distress because they got caught. They are probably not used to this, and as such are in stage 1 and are passive until their verdict is decided.

<li>
Kelly is in a relationship, and it sounds like they are both in it together, thus it is probably eustress - they want a baby. Because of this is probably in stage 1 - alarm and is remaining passive about the stress.

<li>
Veronica is probably facing distress since she went past her curfew. However, since she ran to her room and locked it, it seems she is both mentally and physically running away, thus it could be she was in the resistance stage.

<li>
Sandy was definitely feeling distress since she had an infection and that probably wasn't fun. However, she has recover, and as such is in recovery (stage 3).

<li>
Jane is going through a touch pregnancy and is going through distress. I addition, she is probably exhausted because it has been so rough, thus it is probably stage 3 - exhaustion.

<li>
Kristen is probably panicking due to the fact that she might have syphilis and facing distress. Therefore, she is in stage 1. However, we don't know her reaction or how she is going to face this, thus we can't say if she is fighting or running away.

<li>
We know more about Kristen now, and the fact she choose to go to the doctor shows she fought her panic, thus she fought.

<li>
Kristen is probably facing eustress since she doesn't have syphilis and is relieve her stress was for nothing. She recover mentally, thus she is in stage 3 - recovery.

<li>
Romeo is excited to get out of Stuy after 4 long years and start his life. Thus, his future is his stress. And it positive because he has a lot to do in life. He is feeling eustress. Gina is feeling the opposite, distress, because she lost her bike. However, the fact that she called the cops means she is ready to look for it.

<li>
Sue's stressor is the fact that she will have to take of a child when she in the future and perhaps she doesn't know whether it will work out. It could be positive or negative.

<li>
Emily is probably stressed about peer pressure and her image as she goes through the party. She doesn't know how people will react if she says she doesn't like alcohol, or perhaps she drinks a lot and doesn't know if people are going to call her a drunk.

</ol>

<p>
I do believe there is a validity to the term "White Privilege" because white people don't really need to care if their culture - like their hair style - will offend people. Thus, they have a certain privilege of not having to worried about certain things.
</p>

<p>
Since White Privilege exists, I think to people of color it might bum them out that they have to try extra for something some people get automatically. Thus, they will probably feel down. To white people, they might feel down because they are born into this privilege and are getting judge for it - despite the fact that they can't control it.
