<li>
Organize the risk factors in two categories: those that fall under our control and those that are out of our control.

<li>
Define the terms 'cancer' and 'risk factors ' in your own words.

<li>
Explain each of the 13 risk factors in a few sentences. Skip a line between each description..

</ol>

<p>
Please type, write in complete sentences, in your own words.
</p>

<p>
Risk factors:
</p>


<p>
Cancer is the disease that results when certain cells won't stop replicating, won't die, and impact other "healthy" cells. It can occur to anyone, and cause death.
</p>

<p>
Risk factors are factors that might be uncontrollable or controllable risks that can if they appear (or are done) then they might induce cancer.
</p>

<p>
The first main risk factor (for breast cancer) that is uncontrollable is the fact that due to women's higher estrogen levels (due to their sex), they are more of in a risk to develop breast cancer. We can't really control how our hormone that well since we don't know how every little hormone affects our body. Thus, it is uncontrollable.
</p>

<p>
Aging is another risk factor that we cannot control (maybe in the future). As you get older, more estrogen builds up ad the more your DNA gets damaged. This leads to a chance of developing cancer.
</p>

<p>
Previous Breast Cancer History is also an uncontrollable risk, and it is the risk of having Cancer run in your family or in your personal past. Studies have shown that if you had any kinda of cancer you might develop another kind of cancer.
</p>

<p>
Family History is an uncontrollable risk that means that if your family has had cancer in their past, then you yourself are likely to get the disease. However, most women don't have any sort of family background, but they can still get breast cancer.
</p>

<p>
Generic Mutation is another uncontrollable risk that deals with your DNA (which is decided when you were a zygote). Your DNA tells how your cells to behave, but sometimes due to mutations in BRCA 1 or 2, there will be a higher chance of cancer. Your DNA tells your cells when they should die, but if some gene mutated then it might be unable to know when it should stop growing.
</p>

<p>
Early Menstruation is the next uncontrollable risk that might give you a bigger chance of (breast) cancer, since you have more exposure to more hormone (estrogen). And since higher estrogen levels might give you cancer, early menstruation might be bad for a person.
</p>

<p>
Dense Breast Tissue is, yet, another uncontrollable risk because dense tissue is usually means having a large amount of glandular tissue. This is a problem because breast cancer develops more in glandular tissue.
</p>

<p>
Nutrition, or the diet you eat, is the first controllable factor that might induce cancer. For example, if you eat a lot of fats and have a lot of fatty tissue then there might be a chance that your body will have more estrogen then normal.
</p>

<p>
Lack of Exercise is another factor since it is also correlated with a poor diet. Having more muscles means less fat and less estrogen. Exercise can strength your immune system.
</p>

<p>
Obesity, is another risk factor because being obesity means you have too much fat. This is a problem since fatty tissue might mean high estrogen levels. Thus, to control it you should exercise and have a good diet.
</p>

<p>
Alcohol is a cause of increased estrogen levels, which means that high alcohol levels is another factor of cancer. To control it just decrease the amount you drink or stop drinking it. The more you drink the higher the chance of getting cancer.
</p>

<p>
Smoking or Vaping is another cancer risk since the chemicals is is made of - carcinogens - are cancer-causing agents. In addition, Nicotine can accelerate the growth of cancer. Stop smoking!
</p>

<p>
Using hormonal contraception is the last controllable risk since studies have found that women who use them have a higher risk at developing brazier cancer. So, it might be a good idea to ask your Doctor which is suitable is for you.
