According to Amy, curiosity is the motivator to success. She wanted to make
chocolate because she was so interested in it. She was told by companies she
needed machines, but due to her curiosity she would not give up and got people
to eat her chocolate. Imagination is the ability to form mental images and use
them to think and predict. Imagination can be used to create new ideas and use
them to make solutions. Creativity is the ability to express your imagination to
create something new. They are all linked because it's a cycle, where curiosity
creates imagination which then creates creativity and that makes you more
curios. The more you do one of these, the more, it will get easier to express them.

Just recently, a had a computer science problem where I did not have
administrative access and I had to download a package for a project I had to do.
If you do not know, to do many things on a computer you need rights, but because
it was not my computer I had to come with another solution. I needed to come
with a way where I could use the package to complete the script I was making on
the external computer. It took a whole alnighter and many hours of research,
I found a way - it was to use my computer to host the information I needed for
the external script and then the real package can search for the info online.
Basically, I was connecting two computers, one which would send information, and
the other would receive it. Before the problem I had no idea how to connect two
computers locally, but now I after struggling and not wanting to fail my project
I was able to come up with this creative solution.
, imagination is and creativity is.

I use imagination to self regulate myself. For example, I think of the things
that could affect me and I predict how to resolve them. Like if I procrastinate
my homework and do something fun, I have think of my bad grade. I can use
creativity to come up with solutions for common problems I face and try to
automate the process to solve them; to find the best solution to my problems.

Right now, we have drones that can be controlled through a remote control.
Usually they would be considered toys, however, right now they are the perfect
technology to use in this crisis. Right now we have a 6 feet rule that people
have to follow meaning that people cannot be close together. Drones, however,
are not people and so don't have to be 6 feet apart. Therefore, we can use
drones to deliver medical supplies to those who need them and not be worried
about getting other people sick. Meaning we can help people and flatten the curve.

I like playing video games because often when I play them I am reminded of the
process it took to make them: programming. Whenever I see a video game, I try to
imagine how the game was made and what kind of features it has. This of course
leads me to think of how I could make the features in my own game, thus, I spent
more time on my passion. For example, this photo organizes what I might think
about when I play a video game. For instance, how the graphics in the game were
made. Overall, it flares me up with ideas I could try.
