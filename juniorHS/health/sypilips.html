Stage 1 Syphillis is unique because it has a defining trait known as Chancere sore. Chancere Sore is basically a a palce that hurts on the skin, and it could occur anywhere. However, the stage is mostly painless.
</p>

<p>
Stage 2 Syphillis is unique because as there may be rashes all over your body, you may have headeaches or swolloen lymph nodes. Some people don't notice the rashes because they won't itch.
</p>

<p>
Stage 3 is just basically hiddent and some symptoms may appear. Overall, it's unique because it can remain hidden. Stage 4 Syphillis is called tertiary syphillis, and it can occur decades after the inital infection. It is unique because it can be life-threatening, and/or induce blindness, deagness or memorry loss.

<p>
One can keep stage 1 Syphillis from progressing by getting tested and getting medication. Syphillis has not mutated to resist medication, so it can be easily dealt with.
