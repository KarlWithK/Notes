<li>
Peter pan probably has chlamydia since one have of the sensations is "a bringing sensation when urinating" and discharge from his male sex organ. Wendy on the other hand has syphilis since she only has a rash on her hands and feet.

<li>
Both can theoretically have more than one diagnosis, however, it is very unlikely for Wendy to have anything more than syphilis - perhaps gonorrhea. Peter Pan on the other hand might have both chlamydia and gonorrhea. Wendy is more likely to be asymptomatic because syphilis only really shows its symptoms at a later stage.

<li>
Chlamydia and Gonorrhea for all genders both induce a burning sensation when urinating. Chlamydia and Gonorrhea both induce random discharges and pain. For men there is also swelling in their testicles. For women, chlamydia can induce fever. BOth for women can induce more blood when having a period.

<li>
Both are diagnosis similarly. For example a urine test, a blood test or a physical examination.

<li>
PID stands for Pelvic inflammatory disease and it happens when the uterus or fallopian get infected. It's symptoms are damage to the female sex organs.

<li>
Sterility is defended as the state of being sterile - or unable to reproduce. Etopic pregnancy is when a fertilized eggs grows outside a women's uterus - usually in the fallopian tube, and may cause life-threatening dangers.

<li>
Although, it isn't obvious, but the fact that both STDs cause pain for the man, may prevent them from having sex and thus being sterile.

<li>
It is important to receive early treatment because all STDs impact your life and may cause death. Thus, unless you want to suffer you shouldn't wait and get checked.

<li>
One treatment for both is to get antibiotics. It is important to take the full dosage for the medicine prescribed so that the antibiotics can clear the infection, and perhaps if you don't take it, the bacteria can become resistant to the medicine.

<li>
It is important to tell your partners that you have STDs because if you have sex with them, you can spread it and ruin their lives for a couple of weeks or eve forever. You don't want that guilt on you.

<li>
Contact tracing is the act of interviewing people who have been diagnosed with a disease to see who they could have exposed. This is important because it could help doctors help someone before the situation gets too dangerous.

<li>
It may be a good idea for a teen who was diagnosis with an STD to receive health counseling because it could teach them the important ace of safe sex. People with STDs are more likely to get them again, so it's better to educate them.
