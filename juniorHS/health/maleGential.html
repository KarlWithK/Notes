Adolescence is the stage of life that occurs from approximately 12 to 19 years of age, also known as the teenage years.
</p>

<p>
The hallmark or beginning of adolescence is puberty, during which time the body undergoes physical changes that will enable the male or female to reproduce. Puberty typically occurs between 11 and 15 years for the male.
</p>

<p>
The key sign of the ability to reproduce is the development of semen and sperm in the male and the development of the egg in the female. These developments are known primary sex characteristics.
</p>

<p>
Growth and maturation are regulated by the endocrine glands that produce and release hormones. Primary sex characteristics are triggered by various hormones, most notably testosterone and estrogen.
</p>

<p>
A baby boy can get an erection as early as 3 months and this physical response will continue throughout childhood. But until hormones trigger his ability to release semen and sperm (known as ejaculation), he will be unable to reproduce.
</p>

<p>
Vocabulary:
erection -- The penis is made up of spongy tissue that fills with blood wh causing it to enlarge.. A non erect penis is referred to as flaccid.
ejaculation- The release of semen and sperm usually from an erect penis.
nocturnal emissions -- The release of semen and sperm during sleep. (Also known as wet dreams,)
sperm - a microscopic male sex cell
semen - a visible substance which nourishes, protects and provides mobility for the sperm.
testes- organs than produce sperm and testosterone but not semen.
</p>

<p>
The body is designed to make reproduction as easy as possible. Think of how difficult it would be if the man could not get an erection during sex. Or how uncomfortable he would be if he always had to walk around with an erection! The purpose of nocturnal emissions is to make room for the development of new semen and sperm. What better way to do that than to release the older semen and sperm during sleep.
</p>

<p>
So every process, every function in the male reproductive system has to do with facilitating the sperm to penetrate the egg.
</p>

<p>
Why are there only two genders at birth - male or female? Because that is all you need to reproduce.
Why does a man usually have an orgasm with ejaculation? Because the pleasurable orgasm will encourage him to have sex more often, but also, the force of the orgasm will push the sperm deeper into the female body and closer to the egg.
Why does each ejaculation consist of thousands of sperm? Because it is a long journey for the sperm to swim from the testes through the vas deferens around the bladder , through the urethra and then ejaculate into the vagina and keep swimming all the way up to the egg which is positioned in the Fallopian tube. Many sperm will not accomplish this journey or get lost along the way.! (no driving lessons)
Why does the sperm need the particular sticky consistency of the semen? Because it is the optimum substance to protect, nourish and transport the sperm.
Why is sperm produced in the testes which are outside of the body while the semen is produced inside the body.?
Perhaps because semen and sperm need different temperatures to thrive. Also, think of how uncomfortable the man would be if semen were produced and stored in the testes!

SECONDARY SEX CHARACTERIISTICS
</p>

<p>
Secondary sex characteristics are physical developments that occur but are not directly related to the production of semen and sperm. For the male, the voice deepens, body and facial hair grows and the shoulders and chest broaden. All of these characteristics are indirectly linked to reproduction. How?

<li>
Puberty for men is the stage where a boy becomes a man - during his teenage years. During this time the male body undergoes physical changes that enable the male to reproduce. The start of this transformation is marked by the production of sperm and semen in the testicles and prostate gland. This is regulated by hormones like testosterone and Gnrh which control the transformation. This process if fully for reproduction in the body.

<li>
Seminiferous Tubules are the sperm factory where sperm is made.

<li>
Epididymis are where the sperm go to reach maturity.

<li>
Scotoum is a loose sack of skin that holds the testes.

<li>
Vas Deferns serves in transporting sperm cells from each of the testis to the common ejaculatory duct.

<li>
Prostate gland is where milkey fulid is added so the sperm can withstand.

<li>
Penis is the male organ for intercourse.

<li>
Testes organ that produces the sperm.

<li>
testosterone the main male sex hormone that is produced in a man's testicles.

<li>
Urethra is connects the urinary bladder to the penis.

<li>
Sperm the microscopic male sex sales.

</ol>

I think a deeper voice, broader chest and facial and body hair represent "manliness" in our culture. Thus, having these features will often be showed as a reason that you are better than another male. Thus a better chance at reproduction. However, at the same time, in our modern culture we have people who prefer "more feminine" males, so I am not sure if more hair works in this age.

<li>
Primary sex characteristics - like sperm production - come first because puberty is made solely for the purpose of reproduction. Thus, it would not make sense to have a bigger body if you can't reproduce. It's just wasted energy for the body.

<li>
First sperm is made in the testicles - specifically in the Semineferous tubules where they are produced. After are they made they will pass through the efferent tubules and finally the Epidydimis where they mature. After which, they will go through the Vas Deferens to go to the seminal seminal vesicle. In combination with the prostate gland, ejaculatory duct, prostatic urethra and the Bulbourethral Gland, the now semen (which has the sperm) will pass through the penis and ejaculate the semen.

<li>
Once the sperm and semen enter the vagina, the female sex organ, then the semen goes into the female's body. Once inside the vagina, the sperm swim up the cervix, the uterus, and then finally get into the oviducts where they can reach the egg and fertile.

</ol>
   
<p>
4.. Explain the path of the semen and sperm once it enters the female?
