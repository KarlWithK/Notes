If we can accept science as the basis of a space program, can we accept science when it comes to wearing a mask or believing in vaccines?

#. Is there a point when a society's rage, even if justified, goes too far? How does rage affect one's mental, spiritual and environmental health?
Is there value in practicing peaceful protest and self control?

How does space exploration contribute to health and medicine?
Does out of control anger contribute to or hurt our mental health?
</p>

Space exploration has come a long way. From dreaming to go to the mars to landing rovers on Mars. We have progressed so much. To do all this we had to develop ways / things to go to space. These interventions have often helped other fields. For example, thanks to space exploration we were able to come up with come up with methods to keep our bones healthy. And the more we research about this, we are able to use that research for things like osteoporosis and apply for daily humans. We also found out that eating salt in space degrades your bones. The devices that were intended for use in space can be use in space. For example, bioprinters that can print organs in ideal conditions and we can bring those organs back to Earth and save people on Earth. Medicine wise, space exploration has advanced the analysis of genomes that allow us to predict diseases. Overall, space exploration has allowed us to invent new devices and techniques that benefit all humans.

I think sometimes, anger helps a person's mental health. Most of the time, however, it doesn't. The "sometime" comes from the fact that some people keep their feelings to their selves and keep on stressing alone. Thus, anger, can help release their stress. It's kinda like crying. However, most of the time, anger is just pure outrage and that isn't fun (or helpful) for anyone. This is because rage makes it so a person doesn't think straight. For example - very drastic example - but the NAZIs thought that Jews were to blame for everything, so they started to kill them and caused he holocaust. Obviously, this was wrong, but their rage made them go forward with the killing. So, yea, being out of control hurts our mental health.
