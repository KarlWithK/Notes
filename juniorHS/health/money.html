			Money CAN Buy you Love
</p>

<p>
	What is money? Ask your Dad, ask your Mom, or ask even your pet (wait don't ask your pets), and they will probably reply with a simple answer: "It's what keeps us alive". Actually, I just made that up because they will probably just stare at you for asking a stupid question. Everyone knows what money is: a green bill (at least in the US). However, what it represents totally means something different to others. Ask this and you will get different answers.
	Asking my mom and she proceed to tell me that it represented oppression of the working class. Money can be easily be stack up, yet, some people can stack those bills faster than some families. Others don't need to even worry about money. But why did it matter? I asked. Certainly, the amount of money correlates to amount of money they earn. She sighed, and said I did not understand. There is a certain privilege in being born in a rich family. You basically have your life set. Money can make world turn. It might not be important to me at the moment, but when you have bills to pay, every paycheck matters. "Having money, or the lack of it, can completely change a person's life", she stated. A lack of it might hinder you from becoming the person you want to be. A lack of it might stress you out everyday. A lack of it might wear you down. Without money you can't keep yourself safe, and you can't have all the essential chemicals to make your live bloom. And she is right. Without money, I will not be able to pay my college tuition. Even if you apply for things aid, the college will still be paid with money.
	Asking my dad the stereotypical question, "can money buy you love", resulted in him pointing at my birds. The ones I take care of everyday. He then proceed to ask if they make me happy. I of course said yes. I mean, the reason I take care of them is that they play with me. They adore me as much as I adore him. He smirked, and said, "See?". I didn't really get it...until I did. Money, is just a bill, but it can buy you love. And anyone who thinks otherwise is probably not looking at all the happiness they get from their materialistic lifestyle. Sure, you might get bored of it overtime, but at one point buying a dog, a cat, or a dog, would have made you happy. And now that the pet belonged to you it loves you. Money bought you happiness, and now the pet is helping you relax. Studying materialistic items like games - that are nothing but for pleasure - you see a pattern: you are happy playing them. Money allows you to momentary buy you happiness or have a pet love you.
	I admit, money isn't everything. However, if you claim that money can't buy you love, then you are wrong. It's not that simple. For me to go to college, my parents will need to work hard day and night. Education is my passion. Therefore, paying for college will thus buy me a path for education. So I need to start saving up because college isn't cheap and might the best affordable one to see through my education.

Part 2: The dogecoin.
</p>

<p>
	Back in the mid 2010s, there was an outbreak of people buying GPU (Graphics processing unit) for a PC. Usually a GPU is to process graphics such as in a video game, however, there was something strange about sudden increase of GPU sales: they weren't being used for gaming. No, instead they were used for a new trend: cryptocoin mining. Cryptocoin mining, or crypto mining, is a term to make sure the transaction of cryptocurrency is valid by making millions of computer calculations. The mining part refers to getting "blocks" that is hashed in the network and then the computer "mining" the message to check it's valid using the current blockchain. In essence, the bought GPUs are used to commute some numbers to check if they are correct. In return, the person who sets up the machine gets a bit of cryptocurrency.
	Cryptocurrency is digital currency - it doesn't exist physical. Instead of going through a bank, each transaction goes through a decentralized system. This is why "blockchains" are used to check if the currency is real. The most common cryptocurrency is called Bitcoin. Another popular cryptocurrency is "dogecoin" or "Litecoin". As stated before they are digital, so they can be used to buy things digitally. Bitcoin doesn't have a set price - just like the stock market, its value goes up and down. And just like the stock market, you can sell stocks for real life money.
	Bitcoin is popular because of its high value. It might be worth more in the future, and as such people are saving their coins. In the future this might the currency we use. Bitcoin can be used as payment if things like PayPal doesn't work. However, for the current normal citizen you can't get bitcoin unless you are lucky. Even mining bitcoin is expensive.
