Organize a meal plan.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
I plan to eat 2 meals everyday and have an "unhealthy" snack every other day. I however plan to eat a lot of fruit.

<li>
I will eat vegetables in my every meal so 2 per day.

<li>
I will limit my fat to 65g per day. Salt I shall limit to 1,500 MG which will be a challenge since my family eats a lot of salt. Sugar, I don't usually eat a lot of sugar, so I think I  an eat 30g of sugar per day.
