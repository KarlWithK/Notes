Honestly, I really want to believe beauty is only internal. Or at least it should be the only thing that matters, but the more I think about it and the videos I watched, I started to realize that it's both. It's both but there is preference towards external. The first video demonstrates why beauty is external: every country has a different way people prefer women. In which case, it symbolizes one thing - your appearance matters and people expect something. However, at the same time, the second video showed me that there is also inside beauty because some people see beauty in their hearts.

Personally, I define beauty in the male by having a handsome face. This in addition to a strong character allows me to know that a person is a beautiful. Similarity for women, I think a person needs a strong character that defines a person. Also I think she must be able to smile. People have different standards these are mine.

I think I might parasitic, but I like a lot of things about myself. For example, I like my eyebrows - they are pretty big and people seemed to think I microbladed them. When in reality they are nature. The second thing I like about myself are my moles. I have the typical mole under my eye like it is seem in a lot of Mexican shows. But I love it. It justs add more to me. They just add more to me. Finally, I like my jawline. I have always had a nice jawline and the more I look at it the more I can appreciate it.
