Deception is the act of someone tricking a person into thinking or doing another thing based on false words or actions. Usually when someone deceives someone it is because the person deceiving wants to gain something out of it - usually more power for their selves or simply they want the other person to be at a disadvantage. Sometimes, however people can deceive themselves to forget a distant memory, however, this of course goes back into the definition that people do it to benefit themselves.

As a society, overall, we cannot separate truth from lies. Take for example a politician. When they say that they want to help the people - it that really the case or do they just want to have the position? No matter the intent of people, if he gets chosen at the end of the day he has to do his job, or he will lose his position. Thus, in society we cannot evaluate people's true goals - meaning we cannot know what is true and what are their deceptions. This brings another point, people are vulnerable to be deceived because they think they are right or want to hope that the truth isn't really the case. For instance, the anti-Vax movement is dominated by women, who seem to think they know more than a doctor. This is obviously not the case but to them, who have taken care of their child and heard so many rumors might be easily deceived by crazy anti-Vax people. Thus, even if there is strong evidence to say that isn't the case, sometimes hope can misled.

Superman is no doubt a hero, in fact out of his comics I would dare say he is the symbol of a "superhero" in people's minds. However, at the end of the day, superman is just Clark Kent in disguise. He is a country boy from Kansas, yet people don't know that. People assume superman has no reason to hide his true identity so they incorrectly assume that he has none. However, as all comic lovers know they are stupid if they can't realize that Clark Kent is superman...or are they?

I would like to argue that superman is a lier and a deceiver, and no matter his heroic acts he is still lying to everyone. In various installments, we know that Mr. Kent saves people for the sake of helping others - he was tauhgt by his father to use his powers for the greater good. Despite this, superman wanted to also live as a human and disguise him as superman when he really was needed. Thus, it can be said Clark Kent is superman, but superman isn't Clark Kent. Instead, when he lives as Clark he displays himself to be brittle and weak. And technically he is cheating on himself by having Lois Lane fall in love with himself and his alter ego - superman. Yes, h deceives his own girlfriend to the point that every time in a comic book Lois finds out it's a huge issue because she feels betrayed. And I certainly would not blame her. Just because someone does nice stuff, does not mean he can't be a jerk.

However, not only does he deceive his girlfriend, he goes out of his way to use gadgets to disguise himself even further. The reason most people, can't recognize superman and Clark Kent as the same person is because of his special glasses. They are made of kryptonian technology, and allows people to see a different face. This allows superman to lie that he just writes newspapers about superman and not himself. Imagine a person is so narcissistic that they write article about their own self, while proclaiming he is a hero. Undoubtedly, superman has reasons for doing all this, "to keep his love ones save", but I believe the more he lies the more he is hurting those he loves. He is a manipulative lier who is full of himself.

The impostor syndrome is a common syndrome that makes people that they are just faking how much they know. I feel this way all this time, but the fact that it has a name symbolizes that many people experience this. I think it's alright to feel this way. I mean there is much stuff we don't really know, if you claim you know everything you are without question an idiot. The very fact that people experience this means that they want to actually learn more. After all you would not be feeling this way unless you are unsatisfied with your current knowledge. I don't think the feeling will ever go away, but the more you learn the more the deception becomes the truth.
