<li>
I think Lymphoma and Leukemia are systematic cancer. On the other hand, Sarcoma and Carcinoma is localized.

<li>
The function of surgery for cancer is used to prevent, diagnose, stage and treat cancer. It can relieve problem related to cancer. Overall, it is used to remove cancer.

<li>
The purpose of chemotherapy is to kill cancers cells or control cancer in the body by using drugs.

<li>
The purpose of radiotherapy is to to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors by using high doses of radiation.

<li>
The difference between chemotherapy and radiation therapy is that the framer is used to to kill systematic cancer by drugs, and the latter is using radiation to kill localized cancer.

<li>
Since it's possible to have multiple type of cancer, some one might use multiple treatments to make sure they are treating all their cancers.

<li>
I think a localized treatment would be needed for Tina, since it can focus on one part. An example of the treatment would be radiotherapy.

<li>
Breast cancer should also ideally be cured using a localized treatment, thus radiation therapy would be good. However, surgery is the main treatment for stage 1 breast cancer, so Rita should be treated using surgery.

<li>
Leukemia is a systematic cancer, so Steve needs a systematic treatment like chemotherapy. Localized treatments like radiation should not be use.

<li>
Since Ian has stage 3 prostate cancer, he should be treated with radiation therapy since it's only one place.
