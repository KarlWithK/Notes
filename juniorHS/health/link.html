	Ever since the start of my life I have had a choice in one way or another. Always. However, I didn't recognize that because sometimes the choices you had were denied by your moral compass. Individual independence is the representation of the choices you will have available or the ability to picked them. To be more exact, individual independence is when a person is defined by their ability to take care of their selves because of their choices. Therefore, a person's choices defines their individuality, and, thus, certain actions can bring unattended consequences to a person's persona.
	Stress is a reaction to a person's current situation, and it results when a person makes a choice. More specifically, choices bring stress into life as a change in situation requires the body to react, and sometimes those reactions cause you to change in the long-term. For instance, you see someone that is being bullied; you have infinite choices. One: you can ignore the kid being bullied. Two: you can help the kid. Three: you can call the cops. Or...there are many infinite choices you can make. However, these choices all trigger different reactions based on the next situation you will be at. Perhaps, you picked to ignore the kid, and now you will (probably) feel guilty later in life. This guilt is stress to your soul. Or, perhaps you helped the kid, but, now, the bullies start bullying you. Now you are stressed for yourself. The choices you make can overwhelm you, since there are unentered consequences.
	At the same time they can it can help you grow as a person. For example, having the option to choose what career and college you will attend is your choice. There are so many options. You might not know what to pick, but you have to pick one because everyone is doing the same...or do you? Perhaps, you don't even need to go to college. There is where creativity and imagination help...you can imagine scenarios and plan out how your choices will affect you. How you react to encountering these problems helps you shape similar and combat similar problems in the future. Thus, these choices help you mature so you don't have to be afraid of some problems. You become more confident at solving problems and as a side effect you become more independent...you grow as a person.
	Yet, at the end of the day, picking what to do is not easy. Certainly, I don't know if not going to college is a good idea. I think generally, people are in self-conflict when their moral compass isn't there to solve a problem like this...because they have never experience this type of change. I don't know if it's worth spending all the money into college tuition because I never had that amount of money. I don't know how much debt can hurt me because I have never been in debt. These uncertainties make choices more complicated. Fortunately, I have my dad to help me come up with solutions to these problems. He has showed me what it's like having to spend hundreds of hours to pay off debt. However, at the same time he has inform me that a better job would ultimately place me in a better position than him. Therefore, I have agreed to go to college despite the debt because I want to get the opportunity my dad never had.
	Still, there are times where, despite the fact that I had no knowledge of an uncertain scenario, I was able to come up with a choose myself. I have decided that in a year or so, I will get a vasectomy. I want to be child free forever. Why? I have my beliefs and they are telling me I won't be a good dad. So, to prevent me from beaming a monster, I will prevent myself from having a child. It's my body - it's my choice. I'm sure that when my parents find out they will be mad, but I am proud of my decision. It was mine alone and I found joy in being a man of my word. Ever since I was 12, I always told my parents I will never have kids. By having the vasectomy, I will making a promise to my past self. I have become a better man. My parents (future stress) can be dealt with by my future self. My freedom of having my choice will end the bloodline with me, but it will make me happy.
	Having the ability to make choices is ultimately what makes us intelligent creatures. However, it can go in so many ways and induce stress that, sometimes, I wish that I never had this ability. But, these choices I made have defined me, and I am proud of myself. They have made me independent.
