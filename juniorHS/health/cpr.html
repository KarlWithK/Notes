Hands on CPR is a technique that allows untrained individuals to do CPR,
Cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and perhaps save a life. CPR is a technique that
does not restart the heart - you need a shock for that (AED) - instead it
allows blood to keep on pumping throughout the body. This is important because a
lack of blood in over 4 minutes can cause permanent brain damage or even death.
Hands on CPR requires no ventilation, or mouth to mouth. Instead you perform it
like so: you see someone collapse, you go to them and tap them on the shoulder.
After which, you call EMS and start chest compressions that are 2.4 inches deep
at a rate of 100 beats per minute. This might save someone's life so you need to
do it well. One of the scenario in which you might use hands on CPR is if
someone collapses on the spot. It might be a heart attack and you could help.
Another one is if the person was swimming and they nearly drown. You do CPR here
to restore the blood throughout the body.
