Immunology wars: The battle with HIV
<a href="https://youtu.be/BADDj82oces">https://youtu.be/BADDj82oces</a>
Usually a virus would be attacked by white blood cells, but HIV goes beyond the
scope of the white blood cells. HIV attacks helper tcells which are an important
part of our body. It attaches itself to the cellls and goes to the nucleus to
replicate by using the enzyme reverse transcriptase. This forces cells to create
more HIV proteins and generic material - making more copies of HIV, which affect
others. The body respond by using restriction factors, neutralizing antibodies,
and killer cells or trapping the virus. But HIV counters attacks and mutates and
wares off the immune system and becomes immunodeficient (AIDS). This allows
harmless microbes to conquer the body. However, there is ART treatment that can
help the body fight and be healthy.

How a Sick Chimp Led to a Global Pandemic: The Rise of HIV
<a href="https://youtu.be/izwomieBwG0">https://youtu.be/izwomieBwG0</a>
70 million people have been infected by HIV, Human Immunodeficiency Virus - a
disease that deals with CD4 T Cells, about half of those died.
It is a retro virus, however with the power of modern medicine, it will no
longer be a death sentence. When HIV has killed too many T cells and has left
the body to be unable to properly defend itself against Pathogen a person is
thought to have AIDS. AIDs is diagnosed once a person has developed an
opportunistic infection, infections that normal people can fight off, but a huge
threat to a person with AIDS. The disease was originally called GRID, Gay-Related
Immune Deficiency, due to the prevalence of the virus in gay men. As doctors
started to search for the origin of the virus, they discovered that the Macaque
monkeys had a type of virus similar to HIV, SIV or Simian Immunodeficiency
Virus and HIV was most similar to the chimpanzee version of SIV. Scientists
agree that the reason why SIV was transmitted into Humans was because we ate
monkeys - the Cut-Hunter Hypothesis. Researches believe the virus the came into
the US in 1968.

Why HIV Isn't a Death Sentence Anymore
<a href="https://youtu.be/U52g6ZlR1W0">https://youtu.be/U52g6ZlR1W0</a>
HIV is still currently infecting people and to add to injury we don't have a
cure or a vaccine because it mutates very quickly. However, we now have medicine that can treat these patients
that can help them live as long as someone who is uninfected. Back when the
Pandemic started many doctors treated the infections caused by the disease by
using suramin, which made them sicker. They then tried azidothymidine or AZT,
which kept cells alive longer by blocking reverse transcription, but it was
expensive and with a bunch a side effects and only worked for a limited time.
Scientists figured that to help treat they would need to target the virus at its
different part of its cycle. Scientists combined a bunch of drugs to treat
people - called this treatment: highly active antirevolutionary therapy or
HARRT (ART antirevolutionary therapy). It's so effective that it change the
virus to death sentencing to just a chronic disease. Treatment can double as
prevention, and scientists use PrEP or pre-exposure prophylaxis - only works if
you take it. Since you need to take medicine every day scientists still want to
make a cure that would help people; there are two types of cures: sterilizing
(total eradication) cure and a functional cure (the virus would be in sleep).
The berlin patient still takes medicine but he doesn't need to do ART, which is
why they want to develop a functional cure. HIV hides in latent reservoirs and
as such the body cannot find it. Scientists want to either use CRISPER or the
Shook and kill strategy.
