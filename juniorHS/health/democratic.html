the political system we live under has a profound effect on our understanding of reality and what we can expect from the world around us.
</p>


<p>
an axiom of democracy is that the citizens of a country have control over their destiny. implicit in democracy is a respect for human life.
these choices can be expressed in freedom of speech (1st amendment) or the right to vote (starting with the 19th amendment and followed by the 24th, 26th and subsequent amendments) or the right to a fair trial by jury. (the 6th amendment.)
in addition to jury duty, other hallmarks of a democracy include the right to vote and the right to obtain a passport (the 5th amendment)
</p>

<p>
a democratic system promotes indiviuality and choice.
our belief in our individuality defines our mental health. the ability to make informed choices raises our self esteem and adds value and dignity to our lives. the understanding that our freedoms are supported by laws promotes our sense of justice, confidence and self worth. political values contribute to our conscience, values and morals. they structure our thoughts.
</p>

<p>
therefore, do you agree that there is a link between the political system one lives under and one’s physical and mental health?
these freedoms are based on the u.s. constitution and the 27 amendments which are legally binding.
</p>

<p>
in addition, the american poliical system has a network of checks and balances so that no sole government entity (legislature, president or supreme court) can gain ultimate power, control or rule.
</p>

<p>
when one recites the pledge of allegiance one is pledging their belief in the values of the country “with liberty and justice for all,”. the idea of liberty and justice for all is ingrained in our thinking and in our moral framework --we are not supposed to discriminate. does it happen –yes, of course. but our ideal is to ensure equality for everyone.

abrham lincoln defined democracy as government of the people, by the people and for the people.

In today's world, which is filled by technological devices, there has been talk about Internet privacy. For example, back in 2018 to the start of 2019, there was huge talks about net neutrality. It was the idea that Internet provider must make every service / website available to be surf through. This of course includes any "dangerous content", which was the point many Internet provider were using to stop supporting net neutrality. However, net neutrality was the internet's way of allowing every website to have equal speed. It was a part of freedom that the web centers around. We can say anything and thanks to net neutrality was going to be on the web. However, little by little, after the fall of neutrality, many have been stating the Internet has been becoming slower on some sites. I cannot validate these claims, but, in places like Guatemala, only some providers allow the use of youtube and others don't. As you can see the matter of how the Internet is going to run years from now is being decided in our decade. Internet privacy is another important topic.
</p>

<p>
Internet privacy is the privacy and security level of one's data that is on the Internet. It is not official, but in essence it is the terms that refers to all security that deals with our Internet data. In a ideal world, all our data we post on the Internet should be private unless otherwise made internationally public. However, there have many accidents in the past years that directly violates this "standard". For instance, just this week there has been a sale of the data of 267 million facebook users. And in other news, there was the very popular zoom video app that had a weak encryption that was sending data to China. Obviously, our data is not taken seriously.
</p>

<p>
The 4th amendment is part of the Bill of Right, that forbids unreasonable searches and seizures of individuals and property. Based on this definition from Britannica, I unfortunately, don't believe that the vast amount of person information violates one's right to privacy for two reasons. The first reason is that the Internet is supposed to be public: you post things in your facebook stream, your friends can and should be able to see it. You post a video on on youtube, and people should be able to search for it. As long as you make it public, the "search and seizure" is not unreasonable. Second, and most importantly, although the Internet was made for the US military, it is now something that is owned by the world - nobody really has the right to the Internet. This is important because the Bill of Rights are rights for Americans; we can't just force our rights to other people even if the lack of Internet privacy violated our privacy. We are a democracy, we can't just force things we want. We need to vote on it with other countries.
</p>

<p>
Since it the case that 4th amendment doesn't support Internet privacy and the fact that private data is being leaked, I propose that we make new laws to prevent the leakage of America data and the promise privacy for the average person. Since we are a democracy, this should be the way to do this. Since there are no real laws for Internet privacy, we should make them. As I said before, this is the decade that will decide whether the Internet is going to be gogglers dog or the average person's free tool. We need to start talking about these topics.
