	Hello my name is Carlos Hernandez and I am here to give you an overview of what it means to be a health journalist. Our job is to give you unbiased facts that describe the full truth of what's happening in the world. Thanks to the first amendment we are guarantees we can say what we want and publish about it. This is the freedom of the press, and as journalists it's our duty to educate with reliable sources so you can make smarter choices. AS a democratic society we rely on the people to decide where American is heading. It has been the goal of health journalism to help people decide what specifically is going on that might disrupt our world. As this is our job, we used the fact that we have a right to the freedom of the press to speak out load in the news and online. These resources   allow us to quickly publish the correct facts without intervention of censoring or the government. This allows us to report on topics like big pharmaceuticals that want to make a greater prohibit in times in need, or warn you about possible disasters. Thus allowing people like you to make choices about what to do in times of need.
	Of course to do all the above we need our own research. We are the people who research and inform you about our results. Since that is the case we have to spend time finding scientific evidence that support our claims, and show it as simple graphs you can understand. In the process of this, if we find evidence that doesn't have any supporting evidence it is our job to announce that kinda of thinking is incorrect. However, there are times we often make mistakes too, and in that case we also must acknowledge that we were the ones making up the false information.
		Let's look at a past disease that spread around and how we dealt with it. This disease is called Covid-19, that spread from Wuhan, China in the late 2019. Since the disease is very new we must research for ourselves. Our sources led to us finding out that the disease spreads quickly, however, because of its cell membrane soap can easily kill it. Since this is the case we can inform the mass that the we have preventive methods to deal with it. However, we also found out the virus is more deadly than the swine flu, and of course we need to inform the people because knowing these facts will be critical to the reaction of the people. This is our role...our job, we must tell the people how to handle the problem by giving them possible solutions. However, our solution must be true. We must not make people panic as the mass is looking at us for our reaction. In the meantime we must also inform the people who are panicking to rely on our storage and resources; that there is no reason to horde food or other materials. We must also report on what the government is doing to try to slow down the problem as it is critical that they response quickly. Thanks to the freedom of the press, we are all free to criticize the government.
		Science is the definition of the study of unbiased facts. Thanks to this we can use science to argue a point with logic and convince other people why we must do a certain action. As a journalist we must convince people reading our paper to trust us, using science is the way to do that. Since that is the case, science must be accepted to bring objectivity into our words and truth into the masses.
