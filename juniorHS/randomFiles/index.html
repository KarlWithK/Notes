So a week ago, I was at the park with my friend. We were playing basketball. The basketball hit me at the leg. My leg broke. My friend called my mom, and she said that I better go to hospital and see the doctor. I was in great pain and I cried all day. However, I didn't have health insurance, so I cried more.
</p>

<p>
I saw the doctor and he told me to rest for a week.

<p>
Later that day, I my friend came from work and got me some food since he was sorry. However, he got me something that I was allergic to and my belly started hurting. My Doctor saw my pain, and guess that I was allergic to the food. He got angry at my friend. And my friend started to cry.
