Understanding True Stress and True Strain

<li>
Stress is defined as force over the initial cross-sectional area of the test specimen, and strain is defined as the change in specimen length divided by the initial length, but both are just approximations.

<li>
These approximations are called engineering stress and engineering strain, and are denoted by E

<li>
To determine the true values, it must be be taken into account that the dimensions of specimen change throughout the duration of the test.

<li>
A true curve always increases but in the engineering curve it decreases after necking, the rapid reduction in the cross-sectional area of the test piece

<li>
Necking begins when the engineering curve reaches its maximum value, which it the ultimate tensile strength of the material

<li>
Two reasons for engineering over true:

<ol>
<li>
difficult to measure instantaneous cross-sectional area. So it's hard to make them curves

<li>
Often analyzing deformation in the elastic region, where the curves have similar values

</ol>
<li>
The true curve is used in manufacturing processes and finite element analysis.

<li>
By making a few assumptions we can calculate the true stress-strain curve based on the engineering curve and avoid instantaneous cross-sectional

<li>
True stress is calculated by dividing the instantaneous cross-sectional area at each instant throughout the test. It accounts for the fact that the cross-sectional area of the test piece is changing as the test is active.

<li>
We can assume constant volume because: As such Area * length is equal to the product of the original area and original length -&gt; only valid before necking

<ol>
<li>
In the elastic region any volume changes in the elastic region will be small

<li>
Materials are considered to be incompressible during plastic deformation

</ol>
<li>
True stress can be calculated by engineering stress time (1 + engineering strain)

<li>
True strain can be calculated by ln (1 + engineering strain) also known as logarithmic strain or natural strain

</ol>
