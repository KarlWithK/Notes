<li>
The mars helicopter is going to go on the mars 2020 mission and it will be the first powerflight in another planet.

<li>
In 1985, the soviet Vega missions deployed two helium balloon on Venus. And transmitted data to us.

<li>
The air in mars is even thinner than one percent we have in our room and thanks to that the helicopter can float longer. And gravity is only 38% of what it is on Earth

<li>
The helicopters at earth spin around 500 but this one spins at almost 5x that. 

<li>
It is 1.8 kilograms and each blade is 35 grams - which aout 6 quarters. Design to fly a minute and a half.

<li>
We have a chamber where we can change the pressure to whatever we want, else the helicopter will not reach its full speed.

<li>
Helicopters have something called collective and cyclic and the former changes the pitch on the blades uniformly and move it collective. The cyclic modulates the pitch as it goes around.

<li>
We can't fly this from earth because of the 20 minute delay. We can't use a remote control because humans can't react fast enough.

<li>
Due to its testing and its sensors the helicopter is very prepared to go to mars. And it can do a flight a day. With 35-40 watt battery. Has to survive a low temperature. co2 was the insulator

<li>
It's also a spacecraft and has to launch and survive the trip. Fangibolt is blown up. The first picture will be a selfie. At 11 am.

<li>
It is a technology demonstration to prove that we can fly on another planet. Design to help design for future missions. It can be so much. For future designs.
