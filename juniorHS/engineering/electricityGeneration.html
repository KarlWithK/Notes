How electricity generation really works:

<li>
Generation is the first step electricity takes on its journey through the
     power grid.

<li>
We can't really store electricity so we have to generate it, transport and
     supply it at the same time.

<li>
We generate most of our electricity by converting heat or steam thermal.

<li>
Many plants use fossil fuel and make carbon dioxide and some use fission of
     radioactive elements. Some use geothermal energy.

<li>
Power stations are pretty much the same: once the steam is created, it
     passes through a turbine which converts the thermal energy into rotational energy.

<li>
The turbine has these parts: has a rotor that spins a set of magnets. The
     stator (parts that's stationary). These items work together and creates a
     voltage

<li>
Three individual phases is used to get a a smooth phase that is never zero.
     This allows for a stable power grid.

<li>
Also can use hydroelectricity and solar photovoltaic (pv)but there are some
     cost: no inertia ( power to remain in motion on the grid ) and only works when the sun is out.

<li>
Inertia comes from the physical rotation of all those massive
     interconnected generators. Allows the energy to keep on following.

<li>
Load following is when generation is constantly adjusted up or down to
      avoid fluctuations and to match demand.

<li>
Synchroscope helps getting the frequency just right and to connect everything
