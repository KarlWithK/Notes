<li>
Compliant mechanisms are mechanisms that bend. Orginally considered bad to have flexibility in your machines.

<li>
Like other devices, you can still use these mechanisms to achieve the same amount of force.

<li>
Compliant mechanisms have a number of advantages over traditional mechanisms like: low part count, Simple production processes, lower price, precise motion, performance, proportions, portable and predictable.

<li>
Compliant mechanisms have a low number of parts instead of hinges and other parts.

<li>
Thanks to low part count you can easily make them at a cheap price. And move the parts around

<li>
You can use mechanisms from other industries and make these device with precise motion and don't suffer from backlash, as such they have better performance overall.

<li>
Since the design is almost the same you can just scale it up and have different proportions.

<li>
The simple design also makes it more portable and perfect for space applications.

<li>
These mechanisms can be used with rigid materials and use other ideas to make it better.

<li>
Compliant Mechanisms allow a design to be used as a safeguard for nuclear weapons because it is predictable.
