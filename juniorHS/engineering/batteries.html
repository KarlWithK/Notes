<li>
Electricity faces the problem that it generates so much power and it doesn't
    match up when we need it.

<li>
use electricity in the mornings and don't use at night, but we generate
    it differently

<li>
Fossil fuel and nuclear plants have a single capacity at which they run most
    efficiently and solar with sun and wind is weather patterns

<li>
Duck curve: name given to our electricity demand minus the solar graph, and
    it is a funky curve.

<li>
Solar plants might be causing some problems as it raises instability.

<li>
Peaking plants are the go-to solution for load following on the grid, but
    they are worst polluters. They only run certain hours to make up the difference.

<li>
Demand management, which is influencing the demand for electricity to
   reduce or shift peaks and match generation capacity better.

<li>
Most of storage relies on gravitational potential -&gt; use excess energy to
    life something up and use that thing to generate electricity as it falls
    down. We do using water - pumped storage hydroelectricity.

<li>
It works by having two reservoirs nearby but separated by a difference in
    elevation, then storing the water in the greater height and at day letting
    it go to generate that power. It's a giant water battery. Very responsive.
    Can be used in an emergency

<li>
Major challenges: energy density ( how much energy can fit into a unit
     volume ) and getting the energy back out once you've stored it.

<li>
Efficiently is the ratio of how much energy you put in versus how much you
     can get out of it. You never get it all.

<li>
At a water pump, you still get efficiently at 70% or higher and get a profit.
