How does a camera work?

<ul>
<li>
CMOS Image Sensor integrated Circuit Architecture include the Analog Gain, the Analog-to-Digital conversation, Digital Gain, Image Process Block, Clock and Timing Control, Image Data Transmitter, Digital Logic, Column Analog and logic block, and the CMOS Active Pixel Sensor Array. Together they read row by row to convert analog to digital data.

<li>
A rolling electronic shutter is timed with the row value reading in order, and the conversation works by interpreting the buildup of electrons and converts it into a digital value- from 0 to 4095.

<li>
A light sensor measures the brightness of the environment and a laser range finder measures the distance to the objects in the front of the camera. This moves a lot of things like the camera's lens to get the objects in focus.

<li>
An image sensor is a grid + the nearby circuitry and each square in the grid is called a pixel. On top of each pixel is a micro lens and color filter to focus the light and then to designate each as an RGB value.

<li>
A photodiode is the actual light sensitive region and it functions by absorbing photons and converting that into electricity. There about 16 million of these pixels.

<li>
Because of the sunlight, and how visible light is most around us, after of millions of years, humans evolved with photo receptors. And smartphone were design to produce the same colors of light.

<li>
Once all 2,998 rows and 16 millions have been stored the taken image gets sent to the CPU for processing.

<li>
There is an Electronic Shutter that controls the amount of light that hits the sensor.
