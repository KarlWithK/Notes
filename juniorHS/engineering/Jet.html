Worldâ€™s Fastest Jet Suit <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJM5L9hhBs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJM5L9hhBs</a>

<ul>
<li>
Richard Browning has success in creating a jet suit using ideas he got from calisthenics and how his body moved.

<li>
He need a sturdy structure so he can hold still, and thanks to gas turbine that gives out 50 pounds of thrust.

<li>
There was a sensation of wanting to paddle and because of that you might accidentally shut down the lower engines.

<li>
The solution to getting rid of the feet engine was to moving the turbines to the back like a backpack and creating a "skirt".

<li>
Browning set a world record of having a speed of 32 miles per hour while in a jet suit.

<li>
The heat coming from the engine does not really affect the person controlling the heat as it dissipates and the fuel is not really at a risk of burning up.

<li>
The concern comes from the drop - when the engine fails or fuel runs out, the person just collides to the ground.

<li>
The problem of the suit is that it uses a gallon of fuel per minute.
