Is it Better to Walk or Run in the Rain?  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MqYE2UuN24">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MqYE2UuN24</a>

<ul>
<li>
As you move out of the way of one falling raindrop, you move into another. It is constant and you will always be hit by rain droplets

<li>
Since parallelograms have the same area, then it doesn't matter how much you move the same amount of rain will hit you each second. This concept explains how wet you will be.

<li>
However, if you don't move you will only be hit in the side, whereas if you are running/ walking you will always be hitting the rain drops from the side.

<li>
Therefore, if you stay still you be more dry compare to a person running.

<li>
Given a certain amount of time, you will be hit by rain droplets from the top, and give an amount of distance you will hit the same amount of rain droplets from the side. 

<li>
Total wetness is equal to wetness per second times time spent in rain + wetness per meter * meter traveled.

<li>
To stay driest you want to minimize the amount of water falling onto you from above. Which means it is better to run than walk.

</ul>
