<ul>
<li>
Seeing makes us truly believe they exist, hence people seem to think it is the most compelling of the choices.

<li>
There is a simple trick to allow you to see clearly - you make tiny hole using your fingers and look through it and the world is clear.

<li>
Light travels outwards from a source, bounces off of objects in its path, travels into your eye and retina and forms an image.

<li>
Thanks to the lens, we can focus spread-out light back into a single point, and making it into a crisp image.

<li>
Lens can only focus light coming from one distance away. And it needs to be at a perfect distance to make the image clear.

<li>
Muscles in our eyes allow us to accommodate by squeezing the lens and changing its focal length so we can see at different distance.

<li>
Unlike a lens, a pinhole or small opening can focus light coming from any distance. It only allows light to come through in one place and thus in only one direction. However, it also crates images that are much darker. It blocks light.

<li>
In photography, using smaller apertures makes everything in your phot come into focus.
