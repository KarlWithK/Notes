<li>
For there to be sound, there has to be a medium that that the sound travels through. Thus, we can't hear the constants sun explosions, because it is in empty space and the pressure can't travel to us.

<li>
Cryosleep isn't here yet and the problem is that we are mostly water and if we freeze our body, it will be destroyed. Only frogs can do this so far.

<li>
Your body will not get taller at the space station permanently because gravity will push your "gaps" back when you come back. You are just "stretching".

<li>
Since there is no gravity that acts on you, you can't really tell you got more stretch out other than feeling back pain.

<li>
Space suits and seat on the way back are made in mind that astronauts will be a bit "longer" on space.

<li>
We don't know what gravity is, so the only way can imitate it on earth is spinning the ship really fast.

<li>
Some lifeforms that were brought from Earth do mutate differently because of the radiation.
