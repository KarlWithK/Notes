Understanding Material Strength, Ductility and Toughness

<li>
Material Strength is a measure of the stress a material can withstand. Two values are used to determined this strength: ultimate strength and yield strength.

<li>
The ultimate tensile strength of a material is defined as the maximum stress which is reached during tensile test. The maximum stress the material can withstand during a tensile test.

<li>
Yield strength is defined as the point when a material begins to deform plastically. Beyond this will result in permanent deformation. It is a commonly used criterion for defining failure in engineering design code.

<li>
Fatigue: a failure mode when the failure occurs at stress level well below the yield strength if the applied load varies with time.

<li>
In ductile materials compressive strength is about the same as tensile strength. But the later is easier to test than the former. In brittle, compressive is much larger than tensile strength

<li>
Material Ductility is the measure of the ability of a material to deform plastically before fracture. Fracture at large strain

<li>
Two factors why compressive in brittle is much stronger: tensile loads encourage the formation and propagation of cracks and 2) in brittle materials no plastic deformation occurs to redistribute stresses at existing flaws.

<li>
Ductility can be dependent on temperature. Ductile failure is normally preferred to brittle failure.

<li>
Material toughness is a measure of the ability of a material to absorb energy up to fracture.

<li>
Resilience, which the ability of a material to absorb energy when deforming elastically.

Understanding Shear Force and Bending Moment Diagrams
<a href="https://youtu.be/C-FEVzI8oe8">https://youtu.be/C-FEVzI8oe8</a>

<ol>
<li>
The internal forces have two components, which also has internal normal forces (tensile and compressive ) that cancel out but produce a moment.

<li>
Beam's forces can be represented by two resultants - sheer force and the bending moment. Will depend on the loads acting on the beam and the way the beam is supported.

<li>
Beams can be loaded in a number of ways but the most common are concentrated forces, distributed forces and concentrated moments.

<li>
Can be supported in many ways: pinned supports (allow rotation), roller supports (allow horizontal displacements and rotation) or fully fixed.

<li>
To determine the sheer forces and bending movements within a beam you: draw a free body diagram, and to calculate the magnitude of the reaction forces and reaction moments (everything should cancel out with the equilibrium equations). Third is to determine shear forces and bending moments along the beam.

<li>
If we can calculate all of the reaction loads using the three equilibrium equations, the beam is statistically determinate, if you can't calculate then it would be considered statistically indeterminate.

<li>
dV/dx is the slope of the shear force curve at a given point is equal to minus the distributed force. And dM / dx is the slope of the bending moment curve, and at a given point is equal to the shear force.

<li>
Change in shear force between two points is equal to the area under the loading diagram between tow points, and change in bending moment between two points is equal to the shear force diagram between two points

<li>
when the shear force is equal to zero, the bending moment curve will be at a local minimum or maximum.

<li>
We can use the bending moments information to predict the deformed shape of the beam. Where the bending moment is positive the beam will be sagging, and where it is negative it will hogging. When the moment is zero the beam will be straight.
