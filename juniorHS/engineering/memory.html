Nitinol: Shape Memory Effect &amp; Superelasticity <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI-qAxKJoSU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI-qAxKJoSU</a>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Nitinol stands for Nickel, Titanium, Naval, Ordnance Lab and the wire shows the shape Memory effect - to return to its original shape.

<li>
Nitinol has this memory because of ability to accommodate the stresses and it's molecular structure that can only change slightly (twinned structure).

<li>
Usually, metals have grains and its grain are further comprised of atoms and after being heated those atoms "slip" and move the shape of those grains.

<li>
The twinned structure allows that the oriented be changed to each other easily due to the fact they are connected in the same way.

<li>
Nitinol can be used as a changing material that base on temperature can make something move like an engine.

<li>
Nitinol is more used as a superelastic material due to the fact that even when deformed it goes back to it's original state.

<li>
The wire that shows Superelasticity has the twinned structure but at a lower temperature, but since it is in room temperature it goes back to place.
