<ul>
<li>
The steam engine was made up of a piston, cylinder, boiling water, a fire, a tank of water, and values. It manipulates gas, pressure and physics to make a vacuum. With the help of the Atmosphere the piston is pulled down making power (power stroke).

<li>
Modern machines owe their invention to the newcomen steam engine. Invented by Thomas Newcomen, born in 1664 to solve the flooding in local mines.

<li>
The machine is made up of the steam engine, beam and a fulcrum, and pump. It work at 12 cycles per minute. The steam engine was really the part that made this machine so famous.

<li>
His invention help set the stage for the machines to rule over the industrial revolution. Suppose to pump water out of mines.

<li>
Lack of pressure is called vacuum pressure and pushes the piston and pump generated. The atmospheric pressure is the reason that the engine is also called an atmospheric engine.

<li>
As the steam slows down and there is more atmospheric pressure than steam pressure than, there is condensation.

<li>
Thomas Newcomen understood the concept that water is more condense when it is liquid than its gas form and applied it to make the engine.
