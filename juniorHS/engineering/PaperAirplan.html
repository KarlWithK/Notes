<ul>
<li>
Due to the center of gravity and lift not being perfectly on the same spot, the paper airplane is able to gain speed due to the center of gravity being the deciding factor.

<li>
Origami techniques helped improve the paper airplanes by copying the folding techniques.

<li>
To make the wings a bit wider, you have to make the triangle that disappear without making a crease. Much better lifting characteristics.

<li>
Dihedral angles is a term to describe the angle on which the wings are position relative to the paper airplane.

<li>
An upward sweep on the wings makes it so put the lifting surface so it distributes the weight, this allows it to balance itself - dead-stick stability.

<li>
The lift / bend at the end of the plane allows it to regain balance throughout the whole plane and not just dive at 9.8 meters per second per second. The nose levels up again.

<li>
Collen's model takes 9 seconds before it crashes and goes further out, than previous models. Not all his models are about speed, some go like a boomerang.
