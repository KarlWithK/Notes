<ul>
<li>
The reason why the cylinder shape cans are use is that combines both beneficial aspects of a sphere and box. For example, it has a 91% packing factor and it can be manufactured in large amounts.

<li>
The cylinder is made by having a "punch" press down on the drawing die and making a bowl like shape (drawing). This, in a slightly different fashion, happens multiple time until the exact base is formed (ironed).

<li>
The dome at the bottom of the can resembles an arch which allows the dome to carry more load than a flat base.

<li>
The final steps to make the cans final is to add color, shave a bit of the top to make it even, spraying the inside to separate the aluminum from the liquid that will go inside, and finally form the can's neck (11 steps).

<li>
The reason there is so many stages to make the can's neck is to prevent wrinkling, but overall, it is subtle. The smaller can cap saves 90 million kilogram of aluminum annually.

<li>
"double seam" refers to the curling of the seam to seal the content, and then pressurized to create a solid can that pushes the wall in tension.

<li>
The tab is there so you can open the can and keep the wildlife safe - all without the need of an opener.
