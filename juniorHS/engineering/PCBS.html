What are PCBs? // How do PCBs Work?

<ul>
<li>
PCB stands for the printed circuit board and the circuit we actually see is really a multi layered labyrinth of hundreds of copper wires.

<li>
Microchips, Resistors, capacitors, and connectors are solder into the PCB - the motherboard. The PCB is just a flat board without anything on it.

<li>
The System On a Chip, or SoC for short, is mounted on a ball grid array and connects the brain of the smart phone to the wires or traces that run the PCB.

<li>
The PCB allows each of the components to communicate with microchips via hundreds of wires that stretch to the size of a football field in rather precise organization.

<li>
PCB are made of multiple conductive layers of copper: top and bottom layers are used for mounting components and acting as multiple and antennae, and some layers are for power plane and ground plane and signal tracing.

<li>
Each of the conductive layers is composed of copper and between each of the layers in an insulating fiberglass and epoxy resin that prevents flow of electricity. Most PCBs have 2 to 10 layers.

<li>
VIAS, or vertical interconnect accesses perform this function. Vias are drilled and metal plated holes that connect two or more layers. Three types: through holes, blind via, and buried via.

<li>
Some PCBS are split into a motherboard (bigger one) and a daughter board (small one), some are stacked on top of each other to fit more space for a larger battery. Phones PCBS are light and small weighing 14.2g.

<li>
Through hole components are components that mounted a leg going thorough a hole. They are big, while the ones we have now are called SMDs, or surface Mount Device.
