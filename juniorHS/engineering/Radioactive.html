<li>
Ionizing raditation is the dangerous kind of radiation - with enough energy
   to rip electrons off atoms.

<li>
Measured in units called sieverts and if you are exposed to more than 2 units
   of micosieverts you will probably die. We are exposed to banana which can kill us
   i guess

<li>
There is 2 banans worth of radiation on the earth right now. 0.15 microsieverts

<li>
Urainum is floresant to uv light and it shines purple when it lights up.
   Curie's lab has a lot of radiation.

<li>
Trinitite is the green glass named after the first nuked that made the sand
   into glass.

<li>
An airplane has the most radiation out of all the places he visited. 0.5 up
   to 3 sieverts per 1 hour.

<li>
Chernobyl however, has way more. The plant was so hot that it exploded and
   spread radioactive isotopes. 5.5 microSievets. equal to one xray. Not too bad

<li>
Fukushima has 10 microsieverts per hour. Because the accident recently took
  place you can get dangerous amounts of radiation if you stay too long.

<li>
In the hospital where the fireman of chernobyl came after they put the fire
  out you can get killed if you are there for more than minutes. 500
  microsievets per hour. Staying there will give you your annual dose of
  background radiation. The basement for 1 hour would have equal to 2000
  microsievets

<li>
2000 might seem like a lot but in a CT scan a patient recives about 7000.
    Which is about 3 years worth of natural background radiation. People living
    around fukushima will receive an additionaly 10k microsievets.

<li>
Us workers are limited to 50k microsievets per year. Astronuts will receive
    about 80k in 6 months. And the smoker recive 160 k  and its due to that they
    will die. Lead.
