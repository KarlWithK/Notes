Understanding Poisson's Ratio

<li>
The ratio gives us an understanding about how different materials deform under loading

<li>
Perpendicular is the lateral axis while the direction the load is applied is longitudinal axis. The material will deform in the lateral direction

<li>
Possion's ration tell us how much the material will deform in the lateral directions.

<li>
When the longitudinal load is applied the strains in the lateral directions are equal and proportional to the strain in the longitudinal direction.

<li>
The ratio between the longitudinal strain and the lateral strain is a material constant, nu and is called Possion's ratio named after Simeon Denis Possion. It's positive. Only applied to isotropic materials - materials that have the same properties in the same direction

<li>
The theoretical range of possible values for Possion's ratio is goes from -1 to 0.5, but in practice it's more like 0 to 0.5 and metals 0.3

<li>
When a material that has a ratio with a value of zero, there will be no deformation in the lateral direction.

<li>
Materials with a negative ratio are known as auxetic materials and they expand laterally when pulled and contract when compressed.

<li>
We can use Hooke's law in combination with Possion's ratio, and the principle of superposition, obtain the equation for strain in all directions (1 / E)[οdirection - υ(οdirection + οdirection)]. Known as the generalized Hooke's law

<li>
Materials with a ratio of 0.5 will have their volumetric strain equal to zero, meaning that materials with 0.5's volume will remain constant as it deforms. Known as incompressible materials.
