How Do Bikes Stay Up?   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZAc5t2lkvo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZAc5t2lkvo</a>

<ul>
<li>
Once the are set in motion at a sufficient speed, bicycles can stay upright without any human intervention.

<li>
Come common misconceptions are that bikes stay up because of conversation of angular momentum or their forward momentum.

<li>
When a moving bike starts leaning to one side it will move towards that side and the wheels come back underneath the center of mass - allowing it to be balance.

<li>
There are three mechanism responsible: backwards tilt that allows to keep its center of mass, the weight of handle bars helps turn the front wheel, and finally there a gyroscopic effect that helps steer the bike.

<li>
A normal bicycle is table thanks to a combination of the front wheel and various mechanisms working together to keep its center of mass. However, there are some combinations that work and others that don't. We are not sure what is needed to make it work.

<li>
When you try to tile a spinning object makes the object tilt as if you pushed it at a point 90 degrees from where you did.

<li>
Speed and orientation matter. If a bike is going too slow, it won't turn quickly enough to keep from crashing and reversing the process won't work.
