How Rwanda built a drone delivery service

<li>
In the developing world, drones are used to deliver medical supplies in
     Rwanda. Because they have a lack of roads.

<li>
Each drone is capable of carrying 1.6 kg of medical supplies, 3 500
     milliliter blood bags.

<li>
The design was based on: the speed the plane needs to get into the air
     (averaging 5 minutes from order to launch), needs a gps collection and its
     energy used - that's why they went with a plane design. It's made light

<li>
to remove the delay from the gps they moved it to the battery to always
     have it on and always connected. Removed 10-15 minutes. And made it a
     modular design.

<li>
Their pre-flight test is done by checking the flight surfaces through a
     mobile app that connects to the launcher system.

<li>
They have a pulley and an electric motor to launch the drone in 0.3
     seconds. It launches the same way every time and reliably clears the
     obstacles in front of it.

<li>
Since take off and landing are the most difficult stages, so to avoid
     landing they drop the package. To land they have a system that "catches"
     the drone by the hook at its end.

<li>
The drone has two of everything to make everything safe, that's why they
     got rid of the old landing system - it wasn't safe. No injuries so far.

<li>
The drones cruise at 100 km/h with a range of 160 kms, and serve an 80km
     zone, weights just 6.4 kilograms, made from carbon fibre composite.
     Batteries is the heaviest - 10 kg, but it is rated at 1.25 kWh

<li>
Fitting a large autonomous network of drone into the already busy and
      highly regulated american airspace would be difficult, they are the testers

<li>
Makes 1 GB per hour of flight. And more data could help them improve so
      much more, and are growing more.

<li>
It could be used for all kinda of disasters. Like viruses.
