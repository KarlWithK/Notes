Seven Tips for Engineering Students <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsjwhLcnlg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsjwhLcnlg</a>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Many business will not accept you if you have a low GPA because of your resume won't go through the next rounds. It's more important to talk to people.

<li>
Apply to summer internships so you can get pay and put these jobs on your resume and get some money.

<li>
Take summer classes to get rid of those classes that are needed to graduated, so you don't have to stress out a lot.

<li>
Figure out what companies you want to work for so you can make projects that are related to those companies.

<li>
Save money! Look at ways for companies to pay your education - some business pay for your masters. A higher degree allows you to get a higher pay rise.

<li>
You need to have time management for your classes or else you will fail some classes that only has one final.

<li>
Instead of working alone - do it with others. Get help. And do extra projects! Your GPA doesn't matter after getting a first job.

What is biomedical engineering? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQm-gfobUm8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQm-gfobUm8</a>

<ol>
<li>
It's about using the ideas of engineering to make equipment, devices, and medicine to focus on the human body.

<li>
Artificial limbs are one of the things that biomedical engineers have to make that are popular and they have to deign it with the fact that it will move.

<li>
The electrical engineering parts comes from the fact that there has to be signals to tell the body parts to move.

<li>
A biomedical engineer tests how different biomaterial affects the body and how it can be used to help humans.

<li>
Another part of biomedical engineering is to 3D print organs and other technological devices such as defibrillators or pacemakers to save lives.

<li>
It is very broad so you don't actually focus on everything, instead you can go into specific like bioinstrumentation and programming limbs to move based on need. There are more to choose from.

<li>
It might be best to major in mechanical or electrical engineering and then get a master's in biomedical engineering. This is so everything trans out cheaper and you get more opportunities.
