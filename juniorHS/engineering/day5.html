<li>
Generation is only the first of many steps our power takes on its nearly instantaneous journey form production to consumption.

<li>
The electricity normally makes its way through a series of discrete steps: generation ( production of electricity  ), transmission( moving electricity to populated arenas ), and Distribution.

<li>
Substations are the linkages that connect the whole system together. Short loads

<li>
Substations is now a general term for a facility that can serve a wide variety of critical roles on the power grid. Depends on what the goal is. General is switching.

<li>
As a junction point the grid, a substations often serves as the termination of many individual power lines. Creates redundancy and complexity: connection to these various devices are called buses

<li>
At high voltages, even air can act like a conductor, which means even if you create break in a line, electricity can continue flowing in a phenomenon known as an arc. Defeats the purpose of the switch

<li>
A fault: something that causes a short circuit on the power line. Common: short circuit to ground.

<li>
Fuse, a one time item that prevents s short circuit. Circuit breaker, that as dielectric that stops the flow of electricity. Sometimes in a tank with non-conductive oil or dense dielectric gas.

<li>
A special kind of circuit breaker called a recloser can interrupt current for a short period of time and re-energize the line to test if the fault has cleared.

<li>
Transformers allow the voltage of the freed to be brought back down before distribution. A device that relies on the alternating current of the grid to function. The induced voltage will be proportional to the ratio of loops

<li>
Instrument transformers are small transformers used to measure the voltage or current on grid or provide power to system monitoring devices.

<li>
Regulators are devices with multiple taps that can make small adjustments - up or down to the distribution line on the feeder line

<li>
Safety and are built with a grid of grounding rods and conduction buried below the surface. Same voltages level, an equipotential.
