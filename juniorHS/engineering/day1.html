<li>
Torsion is the twisting of an object, caused by a moment acting about object's longitudinal axis.

<li>
Applied torque causes the bar to deform by twisting, but does not wrap if it is axisymmetric A object that is not axisymmetric will have its cross section wrap will have its cross section wrap

<li>
Applied torque causes the free end of the bar to rotate by an angle Phi, or the angle of twist.

<li>
The angle of twist can be calculated using Torque * Length of the bar over the shear modulus (material property) times the polar moment of inertia or TL / GJ. Can be used to determine material's shear modulus experimentally

<li>
The polar moment of inertia describes a cross-section's resistance to torsion due to its shape.

<li>
For a hollow bar the equation can be calculated using π/2 (r<sub><small>0</small></sub>^4 - r<sub><small>i</small></sub>4)

<li>
Torque generates stresses and strains to calculate it use trigonometry to derive an equation for shear strain. For small angles γ will approximately equal to the tangent of Gamma, which makes it equal it equal to length of B-B' divided by the length A-B (length of the bar). or θr / L. Shear strains increase linearly with the distance from the center of the cross-section. Use ρθ / L to calculate strain due to torsion at any point within the bar.

<li>
Shear stress also increase linearly from the distance from the center of the cross-section, with the maximum shear stress occurring on the outer surface. Hollow bars are way more efficient at carrying torsional loads, since the central part of a solid bar is only resiting a small part the total load. The equation for shear stress is Tρ / J.

<li>
Ductile materials will fail at an angle perpendicular to its axis, but the brittle bar fails at a 45 angle to its axis. Ductile tend to fail in shear, so fracture along the plane of maximum tensile stress. But brittle materials are weaker in tension than in shear, and so tend to fracture along the plane of maximum tensile stress.
