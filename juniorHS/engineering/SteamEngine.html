Steam Engine - How does it work

<li>
The most significant catalyst for growth has been our ability to draw energy from our world.

<li>
The steam engine opened new avenues for trade and caused mass migrations of rural populations into the newly industrialized cities.

<li>
The first steam machine found use in the mining industry, but it was so inefficient because the chain could only pull and not push. A lot of energy is wasted.

<li>
An improvement to this was make a separate condenser, which would cool the steam without cooling the entire cylinder

<li>
Many of the problems the steam engine has can be fixed by upgrading the piston cylinder - this was made possible by John Wilkinson, whose machine reduced steam leakage.

<li>
What we needed for an industrial revolution was spiral motion, which we would need a crankshaft and a connection rod.

<li>
Now thanks to this the steam engine is working on both stroke of the engine
     and improving it, but this kind of engine did not produce constant torque.

<li>
Using a flywheel we could improve the machine to reduce vibrations and stores rotational energy with inertia and evens the torque out.

<li>
Steam engine are steam being used to this day and our power stations use steam technology to convert heat energy to make mechanical energy.

<li>
 Thanks to steam turbines the technology has evolved and become even more efficient.
