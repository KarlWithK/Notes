<li>
Origami dates back at least 400 years in japan and many engineers use it in their designs. Akira Yoshizawa increased the designs

<li>
Origami is useful because it it a way to transforming a flat sheet into another shape with little processing. It can do such much from a piece of paper. Compliant mechanisms

<li>
The simple act of folding a material can make it more rigid . The same properties but more rigid.

<li>
By cutting or scoring materials and adding hinges as necessary thick rigid materials can in effect be folded. The miura-ori the grandfather of this pattern.

<li>
It can also improve the aerodynamics of freight locomotives  and save them millions of dollars.

<li>
Origami motions are being used everywhere like medical devices that can give the devices more range.

<li>
You can use origami for microscopic devices like a nano injector. You need to use math!!

<li>
The math comes down to a way of representing a design called a crease pattern and using circular shape and packing them into a box. The circles are the skeleton construct the creases that way. Make it and then remove the circles.

<li>
The packing method works for anything that can be represented as a stick figure. It won't work for big animals.

<li>
Tomohiro tachi developed an algorithm that works for any surface and origamizer will give you thee the folding pattern that folds into that surface

<li>
Can take advantage of the flexibility of materials to crate specific motions and it's principles are scalable enabling microscopic devices.
