<ul>
<li>
In 1909, the study of old early phone systems began, where Agner Karup Erlang wanted to find how many lines were needed a service a town.

<li>
The telephone company needed to find out a perfect amount so they could save money and deliver proper service.

<li>
A truck line is a circuit that connects switching equipment like telephones and it was found that given an average number of calls and length in a town.

<li>
The average doesn't mean that it will perfect for all times, sometimes there will more than the truck line/cashier can take as if there is a delay the line stop completely.

<li>
The way to solve the problem of sometimes having a long wait is to make a combined queue so the line can keep one moving even if there is a delay.

<li>
Most people prefer single lines, but the truth is that it's slower and thanks to this setup there is greater probably that your line really is slower.

<li>
Gridlock is when people arrive in bunches and not spread out evenly.
