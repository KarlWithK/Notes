<li>
Distribution costs a lot of money and some energy is wasted on the trip in
    the lines.

<li>
Power lines, called conductors, is how electricity carries out.

<li>
Because of resistance energy lost through heat.

<li>
We can reduce the resistance of the conductor by increasing its size or
    using a more conductive material.

<li>
To allow the resistance to matter less we have transformers that lower the
    current and reducing the wasted energy and making sure that as much power as
    possible makes it to customers at the end.

<li>
Voltage is electricity's desire to flow. High voltage means it really wants
    to flow. Even air

<li>
Most of the insulation comes from air gaps, or simply spacing everything far

<li>
Transmission towers are really tall from the ground to prevent from
    inadvertently getting close enough to conductors to create arc.

<li>
Bulk electricity transmits in three phases, which is which there are
    three wires: each phase is space far enough from the other two to avoid
    arcing between the phases. The conductors connect to each tower
    through long insulators to keep enough distance between energized lines.

<li>
High voltage is not the only problem: you also have just pick the
     conductors. Transmission lines are so long that even a tiny change in the
     conductor size or material can have a major impact in cost.

<li>
Stockbridge protect against wind energy. Need to consider the tower's
     impact on magnets and audio.
