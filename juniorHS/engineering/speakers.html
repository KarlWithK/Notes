How do speakers work? Incredibly small, yet impressively loud

<ul>
<li>
Most smart phones have two speakers: a smaller speaker near the top of the phone is used for phone conversations and the larger one for music and other applications.

<li>
The voice coil facilitates this movement and is mounted in the diaphragm and together are positioned around a magnet. When a current is applied to a coil and magnetic field is induced and this causes the diaphragm to move with the magnet.

<li>
A smart phone speaker has 4 key components: A diaphragm, voice coil, Magnet, and a spider. Additional components include pole plates and plastic case and front cover.

<li>
The diaphragm is a think piece of rigid plastic that moves back and forth and generate sound ways by making pressure waves by oscillation - creating sound.

<li>
Thus, a waveform of current can be used to control what kind of sound we will get out of the diaphragm.

<li>
 The last key is a spider, which is a thin piece of flexible wrap and prevents the diaphragm and voice coil from moving side to side. Functioning similar to a trampoline.

<li>
Both speakers are really small and both weigh as much as a dime or less.
