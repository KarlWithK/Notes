<li>
The Gordon Dam in Tasmania is 126.5 meters high

<li>
Air hesitance is definitely noticeable and affects the basketball to move it somewhere else

<li>
If spin is added to the equation, the basketball flies off very far

<li>
The magnus effect was the cause of this: it affects all rotating balls or cylinder as they fly through the air.

<li>
As the basketball picks up speed air goes the same direction as its spin and the causes the air to pave the ball forward.

<li>
The net result is the ball pushes air one way and the air applies a force in the opposite direction.

<li>
The magus effect is named after Heinrich Gustav Magnus who describes it in 1952. But Issac newton did it 200 years before he did. Important in sports

<li>
Flettner rotors are used sail boats and they deflect crosswind to propel the ship forwards.

<li>
It was used in a plane but it created more drag than it was beneficial and crashed.

<li>
Using the flettner rotors to increase its efficiency and reduce the amount of diesel it burns
