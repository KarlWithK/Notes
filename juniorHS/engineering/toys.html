The sphere relies on a mechanism he came up with that relies on a pivot that connects two links and acts like a scissor. This mechanism has the same angle created and thus it's shape will stay the same.

<li>
Chuck Hoberman's sphere was one of "the" toys one had to get in the 1990s. Even though he, the creater, did not expect it to become so popular.

<li>
Hoberman's goal was to make object transform like clouds. He did this for toys and structures that move thanks to geometry.

<li>
Since the person who plays with the toys gives energy, the toy can become dynamic and move around.

<li>
The energy comes from pushing and pull, which give like a domino effect and push the energy to other the other parts, which in turn gave more push.

<li>
Thanks to kids, he got more opportunities and the creator was featured in the Olympics with new designs such as his transforming tv.

<li>
He wanted to create new experiences and benefits, so he sought out to make a dynamic object that could be move and be functional.
