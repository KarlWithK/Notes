What does a Star Wars battle actually sound like?

<ul>
<li>
A star wars battle is not silent because space can sometimes travel through the vacuum of space. 15% of the time.

<li>
Vibration moves air particles and creates sound waves, but without a medium there will be no sound.

<li>
A balloon, however, will make sound due the fact that it will have a spherical propagation of gas particles when it pops out.

<li>
Due to the fact that a space shit has gas and fuel, when it gets destroyed it will make a sound when the molecules exploded.

</ul>
