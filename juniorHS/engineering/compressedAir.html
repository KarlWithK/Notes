Why Do Compressed Air Cans Get Cold?  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjraelDMrFQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjraelDMrFQ</a>

<ul>
<li>
The gas in the compressed air don't expand the same way normal gases expand because it doesn't expand freely in all directions. It is a can of pressured 1,1- diflouroethane.

<li>
The gas is being pushed through the gas and also expanding, and this compression gives enough heat energy to almost counteract the temperature change. Not the only contributor.

<li>
After the stream, the inside of the can has to reach 6 atmospheres but with less liquid. The transformation of liquid to gas requires energy, the energy is taken from the heat / temperature.

<li>
Since the gas is being squeezed out through a tiny valve -&gt; which means it uses Joule-Thompson Expansion. 

<li>
A can of compressed air is a pressure cocker and likewise should be used sideways or upside down because the liquid will spill.

<li>
1,1-diflouroethane (CH3CHF2) is the essential piece to this puzzle as under the conditions in the can it is liquid and a gas.

<li>
There is enough equilibrium to maintain 6 atmospheres of pressure that allows the stream like effect of the can.

</ul>
