How Does the Power Grid Work?

<li>
There are four distinct electrical grid that power all of America! Eastern,
     Western, Texas and Quebec.

<li>
Power plants convert one type of energy and convert it to another

<li>
Transformers boost the voltage to minimize losses within the transmission lines.

<li>
Smaller transformers step down voltage in the city for its final level for
     industrial, commercial, or residential uses before the electricity reaches
     its final destination.

<li>
The vast majority of the power grid uses alternating current, where the
     direction of voltage and current are constantly switching, 60 times per
     second in North America.

<li>
The major advantage of AC power is that it's easy to step up and down
     voltages, a critical part of safely moving electricity

<li>
The power grid is a shared resource and because of that there are
     organizations to oversee its development

<li>
There are three overarching technical goals that engineers use to design
     and maintain: power quality - assume that stuff is stable, reliability so
     users can just use electricity, and supply meets the demand take many
     factors in to consideration.

<li>
In order to take all scenarios in to account, we can computers and software
     that communicate with each other.

<li>
A smart grid can also help the consumer make better decisions on their
      electricity usage.
