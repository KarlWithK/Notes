How Modern Lightbulbs Work   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCEKMEeZXug">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCEKMEeZXug</a>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Bare filament electric lamps were first demonstrated around 1800 by Humphry Davy. Glass was added so it could glow for a long time without actually burning up.

<li>
There are halogen light bulbs, fluorescents mercury and sodium vapor lamps, LEDS, lasers, and each use the use of physics to achieve the goal of being a light bulb.

<li>
Halogen are similar to our typical light bulbs, but have a bit a hydrogen bromide in the bulb to capture the stray tungsten atoms for reuse.

<li>
Fluorescent bulbs are basically gas-filled tubes with electrodes in both ends that work with mercury and current to make the atoms emit visible and ultraviolet light.

<li>
Sodium, mercury, and metal-halide lams are used to light large areas work by using electrical current thorough a gas, which emits visible light.

<li>
Light emitting diodes (LEDS) work by using a crystal of semiconducting gallium, that has two layers - one layer relaxes and the other gets excited.

<li>
The light bulb manifesto is to simply convert electrical current into visible light.
