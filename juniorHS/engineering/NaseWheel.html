How NASA reinvented the wheel

<li>
Even in terrains that we are familiar with, there was still damage meaning
   the in mars it could be worse.

<li>
The following challenges had to be overcome: be as light as possible, and
   stiff enough to support the rover, and be able to overcome any terrain.

<li>
The current record holder for longest journey on an extraterrestrial body is
   held  by Opportunity Rover at 45 KM, with the pervious record being the Russian Lunokhod.

<li>
Each wheel on the curiosity rover is about half a meter in diameter and 400
   mm wide and 0.75 mm thick.

<li>
The rover cost 2.5 billion dollars and had a nuclear power core to back it
   up. Extending the life span for the rover is a main goal

<li>
We can't use rubber, because of the low temperature and the heaviness of
   rubber. The luner rover could use this because of its low weight and the moon
   was different from mars. Rubber would be as brittle as glass.

<li>
The Spring tire use a material called Nitinol which is a nickel titanium
   alloy that has been named a shaped memory alloy. You can bend and deform it
   and then just apply a little bit of heat and it magically returns a little
   bit of shape.

<li>
If the bonds are not broken the material should return to its original
   preferred crystal lattice orientation. But the bonds can change.

<li>
Nitinol has a crystal structure called Martensite, which is arranged in such
   a way that it can accommodate deformation. Forms grains of twinned atoms
   where the direction aligns and they will change when stressed - detwinning.
   Without external energy it will be permanent. With thermal energy it turns
   into Austenite and resets the crystal structure and when it is cooled again
   it will remembered its old shape.

<li>
Nitinol can be induced into that Martensite to austenite transformation
    through stress and strain and when the stress passes a threshold it causes
    the transformation.

<li>
Super elasticity and it the property that allow these new Mars rover to
    deform and recover.
