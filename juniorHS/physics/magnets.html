<ul>
<li>
A material is magnetic, it has the ability to exert forces on magnets or other magnetic materials.

<li>
A permanent magnet is a material the keeps its magnetic properties, even when it is not close to other magnets like a bar magnets.

<li>
All magnets have opposite poles called the north pole and south pole.

<li>
Magnetic forces are exerted on each other when they are together.

<li>
Distance matters a lot, and force is the sum of the forces between all four magnetic poles.

<li>
All magnets create a magnetic field in the space around them, and the magnetic field crates forces on other magnets.

<li>
Field lines aways point away from a magneto's north pole and toward its south pole.

<li>
Stronger field are short lines and closer, opposite is true.

<li>
Two magnets near each other often feel a twisting force, or torque.

<ul>
<li>
Magnetism is a fundamental property of the particles that make up all atoms of matter.

<ul>
<li>
Sources are the elctrons in atom. 1) they move around the nucleus and 2) electrons act as as they were magnets. How magnetic something is decided base on their arrangment

</ul>
<li>
some electrons in some atoms cancel out, and others work together to create a bigger field

<li>
Diamagnetic materials, the elcctrons are oriented so their idividual magnetic fields cancel each other out. Zero, but can become slightly magnetic.

<li>
paramgentic materials are magnetic because the magnetism of individual electrons do not cancel out. But since they are arragned in a random matter, they are also zero. An extenral field makes them weakly magnetic.

<li>
ferromagnetic materials, the electrons align to with neighboring atoms in groups calle magnetics domains.

<li>
magnetized because it develops a response to the extneral north pole.

<li>
materials that make permanent magnets are called hard magnets. Domain stays. steel

<li>
materials that lose their magnetism quixkly are called soft magnets. easy to magnetize

<li>
high temperatures and vibration can unalign the magnet

</ul>
