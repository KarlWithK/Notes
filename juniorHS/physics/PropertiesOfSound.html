Sound
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Sound has the fundamental properties of waves.

<li>
Amplitude = sound

<li>
Sound is a vibration that travels as a wave though solids, liquids or gases.

<li>
Anything that vibrates makes sound. Can't see that sound is a wave because the frequency is too high to see the individual vibrations.

<li>
20 Hz we can hear, but we prefer the 100Hz and 2,000 Hz

<li>
Sound has properties of loudness and pitch -&gt; loudness depends on the amplitude of the vibration. -&gt; A speaker making a loud sound moves back and forth more than a speaker making a soft sound. -&gt; The pitch of a sound depends on the frequency of vibration.

<li>
Sounds travel faster in liquids and solids than they do in air.

<li>
Sounds cannot travel through the vacuum of space. Sound waves can only move through matter

<li>
The frequency of sound tells you how fast the pressure oscillates.

<li>
A low frequency sound has a low pitch while a high frequency has a high pitch.

<li>
Most sounds we hear contain not just one but many frequencies.

<li>
Superposition principle -&gt; complex sound is created by the superposition of many frequencies.

<li>
Our ears' nerves respond separately to each different frequency.

<li>
Sonic image.

<li>
The loudness of sound is measured in decibels (dB) which is determined mostly by the amplitude of a sound wave.

<li>
How we hear sound is affected by the frequency of the sound + amplitude.

<li>
Human voice is in the larynx

<li>
A speaker is a device that is specially designed to reproduce sound accurately.

<li>
Acoustics is the science and technology of sound.

<li>
Microphone transforms a sound wave into an electrical signal with the same pattern of oscillation

<li>
Digital to analog converter

<li>
Stereo is actually two recordings one played from the right and the other from the left -&gt; more alive
