Movie adaptations. You all heard of it: Netflix's Death Note, Dragon Ball Evolution, Avatar the Last Airbender. Ok the last one isn't anime, but my point still stands: industries do a horrible job adapting can kinda of cartoon into an anime. Still I to this day believe that there has been one adaption that was so done so well: Speed Racer.

Honestly, when I heard that people did not like this film I was astonished. I have watched the film more than 100 times over my lifetime, and I even have the film in DvD. To 6 year old me, the film was nothing less than cool. It was a movie about awesome cars going broom broom. And to this day I still think that. Yesterday, I rewatched some of the scenes and the world captured me. It was so weird and that was what made it great. In particularly, I want to say that the last race in the film gave me adrenaline rush that hypes me every time. The cheering, the suspense, and most of all the chaos in the screen. You didn't have time to look at anything else. No. The screen captured all your attention. The screen turns red, then it turns white, and then it's a combination of those colors and you see Mach Six do a 360 turn. It was just hype.

Look I am obviously biased towards this movie, but the film showed that it was possible to make a good anime movie. The film had so much cgi, but the creators just went with it and it turned out that it was alright.

9/10 movie. Time to watch it again.
