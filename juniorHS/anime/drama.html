Overview of 'drama' manga
</p>

<p>
I am going to specifically talk about Kimi no Iru Machi and Domestic na Kanojo.
</p>

<p>
Recently, Domestic na kanojo ended. I dropped it after the first 80 chapters because let's be honest it's such a drag to keep up with manga like these. I was going to bash this genre, but I did enough bashing yesterday. Instead, I am going to talk about why (or at least in my opinion) people like these type of manga. Honestly, I think it is very simple: it's frustrating, but you want your girl (the one you pick) to win. You want your girl to be the one who has a good life. Despite how terrible the MC, you know how much your waifu deserves to get what they want and you want to see them succeed. It's pretty simple. I think.

<p>
So why is it so bad for your soul? There isn't a simple answer for this. I have read Kimi no Iru Machi 3 times now. I reread it every 2 years. And everytime I do, I am frustrated that I enjoy it...there is so much cheating. There is so much crying. There is so many girls. There is so much drama...duh. It's just stupid action after stupid action. The MC never seems to grow. Until they do, and you realize how safe they were before and then you hope they just stay with their current girl, but, nope. They gotta move on. They gotta go with the first girl. There is so much bullshit and I can't stop reading.
</p>

<p>
Drama is so good because it stresses my heart, but it's so bad because of that reason. There is no reason why it should go that hard. Kimi no Iru Machi is such a shitty series, and it's so good. I liked the ending but it could have taken 50 chapters to get to that point instead of 270. The series is the def inion of a wormhole, and it's one I would like to get sucked in.

Domestic is just trash tho.
