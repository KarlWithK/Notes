Controversial opinion ahead!
</p>

<p>
To preface this I want to say that although I recognize that I am biased towards manga more than I am for anime, I think I will bring some good points up.
So recently, I have been watching less and less anime. This is not my first time I have been going through this phase. In fact, back in 2011 I stopped watching anime all the way up to 2014. Why am I mentioning this? It's because I think there is a time in every weeb's life where they quit anime and join the dark side: manga ( and now webtoons ). I am pretty sure you have heard / read some comment about someone saying "just read the manga". And the more I think about it, the more I think that who ever says that is a bitch. Therefore, I am a bitch because I think that in many cases manga is better than anime.
</p>

<p>
To prove my point let's take a look at the only two anime I have been watching: tower of god and otome game. I will start with the latter because there is a pain in me that knows why I dislike it: it's so bland and is practically a slice of life. The reason why I think it's bland isn't because of the story - it's fine and it does make me smile on occasion. However, there is one disappointing fact that breaks everything to me: it doesn't really add anything to the manga / light novel. Yes, there are a few parts that the are brand new (for example the book story), but they are all filler. Meaning they change no character dynamics. It's the same old but it is presented in a new suit. Now this point it just me hating on slice of life ( I can't stand it ), but it just feels repetitive. Seriously. You can't watch it without a " I love sweets joke". Not saying this was not in the manga(s), but the joke happens less.
</p>

<p>
Some of you might be asking, "What about the manga? Isn't there a few low points in any manga?". To be fair yes. There are low points to any manga, but to me it's just a 3 minute read per chapter. Additionally, I have gotten to the point where I can predict where a joke is coming and skip it. I think what upsets me is that studio obviously is slowing down and trying to stop character progression. However, they only add filler. There is not a bit of character development. I think the reason why I am so disappointed is that I love Otome game: I found it around 4/5 ish years ago when the light novel was getting translated and to this day there has been untranslated chapters. I think part of me wanted the anime to fill up that gap. However, there is nothing you would not get from the manga rather than watching the anime - instead you would get less. And to me that is time wasted.
</p>

<p>
Now let's talk about the Tower of God (TOG). Now excuse me for saying this, but from a pure anime watcher... the show is shit. I get it. It's a large world and there are so many characters - that is what the show has shown me so far. But so what? Why should I care about these characters and why does it matter if it's a large world if you can't introduce it properly? I mean legit, I to this day don't really understand everything about shinsu or what the fuck it is. I only get that somehow, Bram is special since he is the main character. And yes haha the crocodile talks (actually he is a pretty fun character). But seriously, they are pretty much one dimensional characters due to the fact that the show is trying to develop them all at once. In my opinion, it's a bad show.
</p>

<p>
But I decided to give the webtoon a shot since people say it's good. And at the time of writing this review I am around midway of part 2. It's "fine". No I am not caught up and honestly I think I will drop it. The webtoon does develop the world more, but...there are still so many characters that I had to ask myself who the fuck was this despite the fact that they were in a chapter I read 5 minutes ago. It's just a cluster fuck. You can have a large cast and still develop it (avatar the last airbender had about 6 people in it's main group).
</p>

<p>
However, now that I read the webtoon, I was affirmed of my position: the anime is still shit. There are so many moments where the webtoon creates suspends by stopping by a cliffhanger. I hate cliffhangers, but the webtoon used them extremely well. You can't but feel there is some sort of stake in the air. However, in the anime there is some sort of atmosphere that makes everything feel like nothing the characters do matters. To be hair, one of the problems that the anime has, which is explaining about the world, is because of how the webtoon was made. Nonetheless, there is another huge problem between the anime and webtoon: the anime fails to fully explain the backstory of the characters like the manga did. Instead, we just get this vague flashbck to a person't story. This leaves a person watching the anime with a sour taste: you have no idea why the characters are motivated to behave the way they do. They just do: kinda like puppets acting in a show. The only thing that the anime does is animate (with better visuals) season one of TOG but leaves everything worse.

<p>
In short, just read the manga &gt;:).
