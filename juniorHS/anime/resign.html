Official announcement.
Honestly, I am not sure where this club is headed. Especially considering that when we come back in the fall semester - if we come back - there will not clubs. I'm almost 99% certain on this statement. I talked to my physics teacher and even he thinks this is the case. Which means that as far as the future of this club, physically, we might not exist till spring. 
</p>

<p>
What's worse is that the current leadership of this club include: 2 soon to be graduates, and 3 soon to be seniors. This means that basically, after this year, there will be no leaders with any experience leading this club. When I became "president" of this club during freshman year, I was leading a club that was barely a year old. During the time that I was in charge, however, there was not that much charge unfortunately ( well we did crunchyroll, secret santa, trips to stores, but our meetings were really similar to each other ). Perhaps, I could have done more, and to anyone who is disappointed in me for that I apologize. However, for now I want to focus just keeping the club alive. So here is my mindset for this club:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
I want to announce an official new president - Ivan Tong. During the time that we were in school for the 2019 school year, he showed his commitment and passion for the club more than Jonathan Lee, or I, could have. I personally think he will be a great leader.

<li>
I will become just the treasurer for this club.

<li>
Every 2 days, I will do my best to start up some kind of conversation in this facebook group. The purpose of this is to keep the club alive. If possible, I would like some of you guys to join in. I am very narrow minded, so perhaps you guys can make this group more diverse.

<li>
I want to be transparent on what is going on to show that this club is live on.

<li>
Sometime during September, the leaders of this group will make a form where people can apply to become leaders.

</ol>

<p>
I know someone of you guys might not care about this post, but I like anime and I love/hate Stuy. I just want to keep the club going. It has been a part of stuy since the late 2000s. I would like for the club to become part of stuy's main clubs.
