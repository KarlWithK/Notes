<p>
Inheritance is creating a new class from an existing one. For example, "Animals", can describe alive, and you can assign an "age" to such an object. This variable can be inherited to all objects derived from "animals"
</p>

<p>
All public variables and public methods will be inherited by derived class. Private variables and private methods will not be inherited. Protected variables or methods will be inherited, but cannot be directly assessed.
</p>

<p>

<p>
Superclass, or base class. The derive class is called child class, subclass.
</p>

<p>
The major reason why we use inheritance, is to reuse code.
</p>

<p>
We use the keyword, extends in the child to create an -is-a relationship between parent and child.
</p>

<pre java>
public class childClass extends parentClass
</pre>

<p>
The reserved word, super, is used to reference the parent to reference the parent class from child class.
</p>

<p>
Overriding methods, redefines a method that is inherited from the patent class. If you wish to use the original method, you must use the super reference
