<li>
Stress and Stain are fundamental concepts that are used to describe how a body responds to external loads.

<li>
When an object is loaded by two but opposite forces, it is referred as uniaxial loading because all the applied forces are acting along the same axis. Causing the material to stretch.

<li>
The internal forces will be in equilibrium and the effects of the internal forces is equal to the effect of the external forces.

<li>
Stress is a quality that describe the distribution of internal forces within a body. It's is force over area and so Newtons over meters squared.

<li>
When the internal forces are acting perpendicular to the direction of the cut, the stress is referred as normal stress. Can be calculated by using the applied force F and dividing it by the cross-sectional area and called sigma σ. The number allows us to predict when an object will fail.

<li>
Normal stress can be compressive (when the forces shorten the bar + negative) or tensile ( when the forces are stretching the object  + positive). Can be on the same object at the same time.

<li>
Strain is quality that describes the deformations that occur within a body. A non dimensional quality and often expressed as a percentage. Can be tensile or compressive.Can be calculated by ΔL over L.

<li>
Stress-Strain diagram can be found by performing a tensile test, which involves applying a known force to a test piece, and measuring the stress and strain.

<li>
Deformations that occur when the relationship is linear are fully reversible when the load is removed, and it is said to be elastic. This is defined by Hooke's law, usually applies for small strains. The ratio between stress and strain is called Young's modulus, E,.

<li>
For larger strain the relationship is no longer linear is and there is permanent deformation.

<li>
Shear stress is when the object is loaded perpendicular to its axis, then the internal forces that develop within it are oriented parallel to the cross section. The internal forces are called shear forces. F / A too, which is the average.

<li>
Also shear strain, and the ratio between is G, the shear modulus.

<li>
Stress state at a point will have normal stress and shear stress components.
