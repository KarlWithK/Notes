StuyCCC
TL;DR: Join StuyCCC to learn about competitive coding.
When people think of Computer I dare say that most relate it to Software Engineering - the act of using data structures and objects to build new and exciting projects. However, there is another use of Computer Science and side of programming that most don't know: Competitive Coding. It's pretty simple: you get a problem that has certain inputs and your code the right answer. However, in order for your code to be even be considered, the computation of your solution must be fast and memory efficient. Competitive coding is the use of algorithms to come up with solutions.

<p>
StuyCCC (Stuyvesant Competitive Computing Club) is a club that focuses on this aspect of programming. In spite of the many challenges this year, we, the leaders of StuyCCC have decided to continue teaching and practicing for coding competitions. This means that we are committed to making club our entirely remote and that easy to join! If you have ever been interested on what you can do with your Computer Science knowledge, we would like to send you an invention to join our club. The only requirement is that you must feel comfortable using python to code.

Thank you,
The leaders of StuyCCC

SJMC
TL;DR: Join the Stuyvesant Japanese Media Club! We are low commitment and have a discord!

Are you interested in anime or manga? Do you like talking to others about building your gunpla model kit? Did you just win your favorite character in a gacha and want to share this info? Do you just want a place to talk about light novels? Well, if you said yes to any of these questions, then you will probably be interested in joining the Stuyvesant Japanese Media Club (StuyJMC for short). Our club offers a place for discussion for any Japanese Media. Along with it, we offer free Crunchyroll, the largest and most stable Stuy discord server, and a place to just talk about Stuy. What's more is that we are starting a weekly event on Friday where we watch an anime movie after school on our discord. We are entirely low commitment, so you can even come just once a month, and we would be cool with it. If you are interested, then join our Facebook page (and discord).
