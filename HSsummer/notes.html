Posse made by a lady who wanted to bring together kids together through college.

In your high school years, what did you learn about yourself as a student?

<p>
What will going to college mean for you, your family, or your community? In your high school years, what did you learn about yourself as a student? Think of a time you achieved a personal goal. Tell us how you met your goal and why that goal was important to you. Talk about a time you effectively negotiated a conflict. 
</p>


<p>
Ever since I started going into Stuyvesant High School, I have learned I am not the best. It might sound cocky, but I think I was the best when it came to technology. Stuyvesant High School is a school of competition. It is a school of scholars. It is a school of wonderful people who do so much. However, the fall to being knocked into common sense and understanding that I am not the best has helped me out so much.
</p>


<p>
Firstly, it has helped me excel much more into technology: I dare not say I would be the best in my school, but I am definitely part of the top 1%. In a school of 3000+ students, I am very proud of accomplishing this. The fact is without the competition of the school, I might have never pushed myself into learning rust, competitive coding, systems, and linux. But due to the pressure, I did and want to learn more.
</p>


<p>
I think it's easy to want to learn more and study about a topic you are passionate about. However, in reality, pushing yourself to a college level is quite the leap. I have already taken some of the senior year classes for computer science when I was a junior, and now I am not sure what I should be excited for in my senior year. I want to learn more, but it's very difficult to motivate yourself to approach harder topics without guidance. However, if there is one thing remote learning has taught me it is that I can pretty much teach myself most topics on computer science if I look hard enough on youtube. There are even some colleges that offer free courses for students. I took a cybersecurity course this summer that will save me money.
</p>

<p>
Finally, I discovered that sometimes it is difficult to understand various topics. For example in computer science, you might have this moment where you are on a problem and you spend 3+ hours on it and can't figure it out. Those things happen. And I discovered that sometimes it is best to take a break and go on a run to clear your mind, and maybe you will get the answer. Although, another solution would be to look up a tutorial on how to solve the problem.
</p>

<p>
People who learn computer science rely on each other. To solve problems, they crate programs to help them and others. In essence, this mindset is what brought upon the internet and open software: people want to help each other. I also wanted to help my fellow students, and so I created a youtube channel to help people when they are stuck in reading documentation for a program. This way I contribute to the community that has always helped me.
</p>


<p>
At the end of the day, I want to reach higher heights with computer science. My parents have never gone to college, and it will be difficult transition for me. Nonetheless, I want to do it. But I don't want to stop there: I want to go higher. I want to get a PhD in bioinformatics. I  know there will be a lot of pressure in keeping up with PhD students, and I want to take that challenge to learn more.
