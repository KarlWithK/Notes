<div id="SYN Flood"><h1 id="SYN Flood" class="header"><a href="#SYN Flood">SYN Flood</a></h1></div>
<ul>
<li>
Typically DOS attack, through can be combined with other attack such as TCP hijacking

<li>
Rely on sending TCP conneciton requests faster than the serer can process them

<li>
Attacker creates a large number of packets with spoofed source addresses and setting the SYN flag on these

<li>
The server resonds with a SYN/ACK for which is never gets a response (waits for about 3 minutes each)

<li>
Eventually the sever stops accepting connection requests, thus triggering a denial of service

<li>
Can be solved in mutiple ways

<li>
One the common way to do this is to use SYN cookies.

</ul>


<div id="TCP Data Transfer"><h1 id="TCP Data Transfer" class="header"><a href="#TCP Data Transfer">TCP Data Transfer</a></h1></div>
<p>
During connection initalization using the three way handshake, inital sequence numbers are exchanged
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The TCP header includes a 16 bit checksum of the data and parts of the header, including the source and destination.

<li>
Acknowledgment is used by TCP to keep track of network congestion and control flow

<li>
TCP connections are terminated with a 4-way handsahke:

<ul>
<li>
The client which wishes to terminate the conection sends a DIN message to the other client

<li>
The other client responds by sending an ACK

<li>
the other clients sends a FIN

<li>
the original client now sends an ACK, and the connections is terminated.

</ul>
</ul>

<div id="TCP Data Transfer-TCP congestion Control"><h2 id="TCP congestion Control" class="header"><a href="#TCP Data Transfer-TCP congestion Control">TCP congestion Control</a></h2></div>
<ul>
<li>
During the 80s, uncontrolled TCP messages casued large scale network congestion

</ul>


<div id="TCP Data Transfer-Optimistic ACK attack"><h2 id="Optimistic ACK attack" class="header"><a href="#TCP Data Transfer-Optimistic ACK attack">Optimistic ACK attack</a></h2></div>
<ul>
<li>
Takes advantage of the TCP congestion control

<li>
Sends flood of ACKS and the server used bandwidth that it does have

<li>
Finally the network is no longer reachable

</ul>

<div id="TCP Data Transfer-IP Spoofing"><h2 id="IP Spoofing" class="header"><a href="#TCP Data Transfer-IP Spoofing">IP Spoofing</a></h2></div>
<p>
An attempt by an intruder to send packets from one IP address that appear to originate at another.
Blind spoofing:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Attack from any source

</ul>
<p>
Non blind spoofing:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Attacker is from same subnet

</ul>

<div id="TCP Data Transfer-Blind IP Spoofing"><h2 id="Blind IP Spoofing" class="header"><a href="#TCP Data Transfer-Blind IP Spoofing">Blind IP Spoofing</a></h2></div>
<p>
The TCP/IP protocol requires that "acknowledgment"  number be sent across sessions
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Makes sure that the client is getting the server's packets and vice verser

</ul>

<div id="TCP Data Transfer-NON-blind"><h2 id="NON-blind" class="header"><a href="#TCP Data Transfer-NON-blind">NON-blind</a></h2></div>
<p>
IP spoofing without inherit wetly knowing the acknowledgments sequence pattern
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Done on the same subnet

<li>
Use a packet sniffer to analyze the sequence

</ul>

<div id="TCP Data Transfer-NON-blind-Packet Sniffers"><h3 id="Packet Sniffers" class="header"><a href="#TCP Data Transfer-NON-blind-Packet Sniffers">Packet Sniffers</a></h3></div>
<p>
Packer sniffers "read" information transversing a network:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Packet sniffers intercept network packets, possibly using ARP cache posioning

</ul>


<div id="TCP Data Transfer-NON-blind-Stop Packet Sniffing"><h3 id="Stop Packet Sniffing" class="header"><a href="#TCP Data Transfer-NON-blind-Stop Packet Sniffing">Stop Packet Sniffing</a></h3></div>
<p>
Best way it to encrypt packets securely
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Sniffers can capture the packets, but they are meaningless:

<li>
SSH is also secure as public/private key are secure

<li>
Switch networks

<li>
The best security is not let them in the first place.

</ul>

<div id="TCP Data Transfer-User datagram Protocol"><h2 id="User datagram Protocol" class="header"><a href="#TCP Data Transfer-User datagram Protocol">User datagram Protocol</a></h2></div>
<p>
UDP is stateless, unreliable datagram protocol built on top of IP, that it lies on level 4
</p>
<ul>
<li>
It does not provide delivery guarantees, or acknowledgments, but it is faster

<li>
Can distinguished data for multiple concurrent applications on a single host.

</ul>

<div id="TCP Data Transfer-Network address translation"><h2 id="Network address translation" class="header"><a href="#TCP Data Transfer-Network address translation">Network address translation</a></h2></div>
<p>
Alleviate IPv4 address space congestion
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Relies on translating address in an internal network, to an external address that is used for communication to and from the outside world

<li>
NAT is usually implemented by placing a router in between the internal private network and the public network

</ul>
