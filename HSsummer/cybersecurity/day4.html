<div id="Computer Forensics"><h1 id="Computer Forensics" class="header"><a href="#Computer Forensics">Computer Forensics</a></h1></div>
<p>
Scientific process of persevering, identifying, extracting, documenting, and interpreting data on a computer.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Used to obtain potential legal evidence.

</ul>

<div id="The forensic Paradigm"><h1 id="The forensic Paradigm" class="header"><a href="#The forensic Paradigm">The forensic Paradigm</a></h1></div>
<p>
4 Stages: Identification, Collection, Analysis &amp; Evaluation, and Reporting
</p>


<div id="The forensic Paradigm-Identification"><h2 id="Identification" class="header"><a href="#The forensic Paradigm-Identification">Identification</a></h2></div>
<ul>
<li>
Identification: identity specific objects that store important data for the case analysis:

<ul>
<li>
You only care about the data -&gt; hard drive

</ul>
</ul>

<div id="The forensic Paradigm-Collection"><h2 id="Collection" class="header"><a href="#The forensic Paradigm-Collection">Collection</a></h2></div>
<p>
Collection establish a chain of custody and document all steps to prove they the data collected data remains intact and unaltered:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
maintaining the chain of custody:

<ul>
<li>
Maintain possession of all objects

<li>
must be able to trace evidence back to source

<li>
prove source integrity

</ul>
<li>
Priority by volatility:

<ul>
<li>
Some data is more volatile

<li>
RAM &gt; swap &gt; disk &gt; CDs/DVDs

<li>
capture more volatile evidence first.

</ul>
<li>
Using only tools and methods that have been tested and evaluated to validate their accuracy and reliability.

</ul>

<div id="The forensic Paradigm-Collection-Why use images"><h3 id="Why use images" class="header"><a href="#The forensic Paradigm-Collection-Why use images">Why use images</a></h3></div>
<ul>
<li>
Information on digital media is easily changed.

<li>
Once changed it is usually impossible to detect that a change has taken place unless other measures have been taken

<li>
Calculate cryptographic has to establish a check point

<li>
examining a live file changes state of the evidence

<li>
The media is the crime scene.

<li>
Protecting the crime scene is paramount as once evidence is contaminated, it cannot be decontaminated -&gt; only one try

<li>
A digital image copy allows preservation of the original evidence, prevents alteration of original evidence and allows recreation of the data.

<li>
A file copy does not do the above

</ul>

<div id="The forensic Paradigm-Analysis and Evaluation"><h2 id="Analysis and Evaluation" class="header"><a href="#The forensic Paradigm-Analysis and Evaluation">Analysis and Evaluation</a></h2></div>
<p>
Determination of the type of information stored on digital evidence and conduct a through analysis of the media
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Know where evidence can be found

<li>
Understand techniques used to hide or "destroy" digital data

<li>
toolbox of techniques to discover hidden data and recover "destroyed" data

<li>
cope with HUGE qualities of digital data

<li>
Ignore the irrelevant, target the relevant

<li>
Thoroughly understand circumstances which may make "evidence" unreliable:

<li>
Where is the evidence:

<ul>
<li>
Undeleted files, expect some names to be incorrect

<li>
Deleted files

<li>
windows registry

<li>
print spool files

<li>
hibernation files

<li>
temp files

<li>
slack space:

<ul>
<li>
Slack space is the space between the logical end of the file and the physical end of the file.

</ul>
<li>
Internet history.

</ul>
</ul>

<div id="The forensic Paradigm-Reporting"><h2 id="Reporting" class="header"><a href="#The forensic Paradigm-Reporting">Reporting</a></h2></div>
<p>
Prepare and deliver an official report
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Describe the incident

<li>
Be able to withstand decision makers

<li>
offer valid conclusions, and opinions, or recommendations.

</ul>


<div id="Digital forensics tools"><h1 id="Digital forensics tools" class="header"><a href="#Digital forensics tools">Digital forensics tools</a></h1></div>
<p>
Command line tools that are guaranteed not to alter the disk:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
HELIX: a live cd with plenty of forensic tools ready to be used

<li>
ENCASE: A series of proprietary forensic software produced by Guidance software

</ul>

<div id="How to hide data"><h1 id="How to hide data" class="header"><a href="#How to hide data">How to hide data</a></h1></div>
<ul>
<li>
Cryptography

<li>
Stenography: the process of hiding data inside other data

<li>
Change file names and extensions. .doc -&gt; .tmp

<li>
Hidden tracks:

<ul>
<li>
Most hard disks have # of tracks hidden

<li>
They can be used to hide/read data by using a hex editor

</ul>
<li>
Deleted files

</ul>

<div id="How to hide data-Bitstream vs Backups"><h2 id="Bitstream vs Backups" class="header"><a href="#How to hide data-Bitstream vs Backups">Bitstream vs Backups</a></h2></div>
<ul>
<li>
Forensics copies (Bitstream):

<ul>
<li>
Bit for bit copying captures all the data on the copied data

<li>
Including hidden and residual data

<li>
Often the "smoking gun" is found in the residual data

</ul>
</ul>

<div id="Anti-Forensic and data security"><h1 id="Anti-Forensic and data security" class="header"><a href="#Anti-Forensic and data security">Anti-Forensic and data security</a></h1></div>
<p>
There are techniques that try to prevent forensic investigators to do their work.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Securely deleting data, so that it cannot be restored with forensic methods

<li>
Prevent the creation of certain data in for first place

<li>
Data which was never there, obviously cannot be restored with these methods.

<li>
A desgausser Magnetic Field or Shredder or termite can destroy the media.

<li>
Just wipe the media with a simple erase or destructive erase

</ul>
