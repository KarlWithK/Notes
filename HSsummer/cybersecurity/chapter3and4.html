Basics of Windows Security
<a href="https://youtu.be/Ed_2BKn3QR8">https://youtu.be/Ed_2BKn3QR8</a>
Overall this video was extremely concise, and well-made. It taught the basics of the security principal: who to authenticate and how to identify them - SID. A SID is an identifier that is formulated using a unique number. This is informant to allow multiple users to have the same name, but different data. The video explicitly states that it is better to disable a user than to delete a user as it allows transfer of permissions. Access Control Entry are part of an Access Control List that grants permissions to read / write to a file. These two items evaluate the user's SID to check if they have the correct permissions. The video finally showed that the way to secure the SID is to have an Access Token that prevents major attacks from using a fabricated SID. The user would need to relog in to allow another try at getting a token if the token was changed. The great thing about this video is that there were images and videos that showed exactly what was he was talking about. 9/ 10. A bit too long, but great examples.

Ethical Hacking: Buffer Overflow Basics
<a href="https://youtu.be/SOoJcrR4Ijo">https://youtu.be/SOoJcrR4Ijo</a>
The graphics in this video make it simple for a beginner to learn what the narrator was talking about. I learned that a buffer "is a temporary data storage area that has a limited space allocated for any single task". Hoover, must programmers don't implement a check for their programs to not use a safe amount of resources. If things goes wrong a buffer overflow occurs, and data can be overwritten to make room for new data that is processed. If there is a lack of memory, buffer overflow can happen and crash the program and security flaws. Preventing the problem is hard because there must be constant monitoring and some functions don't check for the it. I thought it was a 10/10 video as it was short and to the point.

Cybersecurity Awareness Training - Malware
<a href="https://youtu.be/juw6sPEGuEk">https://youtu.be/juw6sPEGuEk</a>
The video used crisp animations to show the similarities of cyberviruses and human viruses. It described how cyberviruses can be attained anywhere and how they can destroy data or forcing users to pay to get rid of the virus. It further illustrated how there are subtypes of viruses like virus, worm, trojan, rootkit, and spyware. All which are harmful and perform malicious actions like logging your keystrokes. I think overall, it was a nice video, but it was too general and fast. Therefore, it was a 8/10 video.

Chapter 7 9 Intro to Malware
<a href="https://youtu.be/OdjZ9p_TAWc">https://youtu.be/OdjZ9p_TAWc</a>
Although the animation of this video are not as professional as the others, I thought it was well researched. It taught the definition of a malware - a "software that executes on your machine and has malicious effect on it". It describes several malware like: Trojans horses that pretend to do something else to be installed, back doors to gain access to a program without authentication, rootkits that deal on a kernel level, ransom ware that demands payment to unlock the computer, adware that use ads to attack the user, spyware that obtain all kinds of information, worms that duplicates themselves, botnets that take over a computer and crash it, and finally there is the classic virus. The narrator suggest to never download anything from a email and download an antivirus software that checks for signatures. The video was concise and very informational.
