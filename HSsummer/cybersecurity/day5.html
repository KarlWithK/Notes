<ul>
<li>
Electricity: needs energy 24/7

<li>
Temperate: CPU are hot so they need the right temperature

<li>
Limited conductance: Make sure there is no electric magnetic force in the room

</ul>

<p>
Secretly listen to someone's conversation.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The direct observation techniques are commonly referred to as should surfings.

</ul>

<div id="Direct Attacks on Computational Devices-Wiretapping"><h2 id="Wiretapping" class="header"><a href="#Direct Attacks on Computational Devices-Wiretapping">Wiretapping</a></h2></div>
<ul>
<li>
Use Inexpensive coaxial copper cables -&gt; information is transmitted via electrical impulses in these cables.

<li>
Relatively inexpensive means that attackers can reconstruct the data being transferred through the tapped cable and eavesdrop on network traffic.

<li>
Wiretapping attacks are passive and very difficult to detect

</ul>

<div id="Direct Attacks on Computational Devices-Signal Eminations"><h2 id="Signal Eminations" class="header"><a href="#Direct Attacks on Computational Devices-Signal Eminations">Signal Eminations</a></h2></div>
<ul>
<li>
Computers screens emit radio frequencies that can be used to detect what is being displayed.

<li>
Visible light reflections can also be used to reconstruct a display from its reflection on a wall, coffee mug, or eyeglass.

</ul>

<div id="Direct Attacks on Computational Devices-Acoustic Emissions"><h2 id="Acoustic Emissions" class="header"><a href="#Direct Attacks on Computational Devices-Acoustic Emissions">Acoustic Emissions</a></h2></div>
<ul>
<li>
An attacker could use an audio recording of a user typing on a keyboard to reconstruct what was typed since each keystrokes has minute difference in the sound it produces, and curtain keys are known to be pressed more than others.

<li>
A trained neural network recognized 79% of all keystrokes.

</ul>

<div id="Direct Attacks on Computational Devices-Hardware key loggers"><h2 id="Hardware key loggers" class="header"><a href="#Direct Attacks on Computational Devices-Hardware key loggers" class="justcenter">Hardware key loggers</a></h2></div>
<p>
 A key logger is any means of recording a victim's keystrokes, typically used to eavesdrop passwords or other sensitive information.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Typically small connectors that are installed between  keyboard and a computer.

</ul>

<p>
US government code word for a set of standards for limiting information-carrying electromagnetic emanations from computing equipment.
Thee zones that determine protection level:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
No direct contact with equipment. 1 Meter

<li>
No closer than 20 meters or some sort of blockage.

<li>
No closer than 100 meters

</ol>

<div id="Emanation Blockage"><h1 id="Emanation Blockage" class="header"><a href="#Emanation Blockage">Emanation Blockage</a></h1></div>
<ul>
<li>
We can enclose sensitive equipment in a windowless roomm

<li>
To block acoustic emanations, we use sound-dampening materials.

<li>
To block electromagnetic emanations we can make sure every cord and cable is well grounded and insulated:

<ul>
<li>
Faraday cage is a perfect example of this. They have holes that smaller than the wavelengths of the electromagnetic radiation and block it from passing.

</ul>
</ul>

<div id="Computer Forensics"><h1 id="Computer Forensics" class="header"><a href="#Computer Forensics">Computer Forensics</a></h1></div>
<p>
Practice of obtaining information contained on a electronic devices for legal proceedings.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Attacks use same techniques.

<li>
Involves the physical inspection of the components of a computer to the microscopic level or the electronic inspection of a computer's parts.

</ul>
<div id="ATMS"><h1 id="ATMS" class="header"><a href="#ATMS">ATMS</a></h1></div>
<p>
An automatic teller machine (ATM) is any device that allows customers of financial institutions to complete withdrawn and deposit transactions without humans assistance.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Has internal cryptographic processor that encrypts the entered pin and compares it to cache

<li>
The processor encrypts all information to ensure confidentiality of a user.

<li>
Runs under the Triple DES (3DES) crytosystem standard, a legacy symmetric cryposystem with up to 112 bits of security.

<li>
3DES secret keys installed on an ATM are either loaded on-site by technicians or downloaded remotely from the vender

</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Lebanese Loop: A sleeve is inserted into the card slot that makes the user card be stuck in the sleeve.

<li>
Skimmer: a device that stores users' credit information to make duplicates of the original card

<li>
Fake ATMs: capture all information.

</ul>
