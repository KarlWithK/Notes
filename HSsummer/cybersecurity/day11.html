<div id="Day 11-Trojan Horses"><h2 id="Trojan Horses" class="header"><a href="#Day 11-Trojan Horses">Trojan Horses</a></h2></div>
<p>
A trojan horse is a malware program that appears to perform some useful task, but which also does something with negative consequences.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Trojan horses can be installed as part of the payload or other malware but are often installed by a user or administrator, sometimes accidentally.

<li>
Have largest infection potential

</ul>


<div id="Day 11-Rootkits"><h2 id="Rootkits" class="header"><a href="#Day 11-Rootkits">Rootkits</a></h2></div>
<p>
A rootkit modifies the OS to hide its existence:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Modifies file system exploration utilities.

<li>
Hard to detect using software that relies on the OS itself

</ul>
<li>
RootkitRevealer:

<ul>
<li>
By Bryce Cogswell and Mark Russinovich

<li>
Two scans of file system

<li>
High-level scan using the windows API

<li>
Raw scan using disk access methods

<li>
Discrepancy reveals presence of rootkit

<li>
Could be defeated by rootkit that intercepts and modifies results of raw scan operations.

</ul>

<div id="Financial Impact"><h1 id="Financial Impact" class="header"><a href="#Financial Impact">Financial Impact</a></h1></div>
<p>
Malware often affects a large user population
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Significant financial impact, through estimates vary widely, up to $100B per year

<li>
New malware threats have grown

</ul>

<div id="Financial Impact-Professional Malware"><h2 id="Professional Malware" class="header"><a href="#Financial Impact-Professional Malware">Professional Malware</a></h2></div>
<p>
Growth in professional cyber crime and online fraud has led to demand for professionally developed malware.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
New malware is often a custom designed variations of known exploits, so the malware designer can sell different "products" to his/her customers.

</ul>

<div id="Financial Impact-Adware and Spyware"><h2 id="Adware and Spyware" class="header"><a href="#Financial Impact-Adware and Spyware">Adware and Spyware</a></h2></div>
<ul>
<li>
Adware sends more ads

<li>
Spyware sends your data like keystrokes

</ul>

<div id="Signatures: A Malware Countermeasure"><h1 id="Signatures: A Malware Countermeasure" class="header"><a href="#Signatures: A Malware Countermeasure">Signatures: A Malware Countermeasure</a></h1></div>
<p>
Scan compare the analyzed object with a database of signatures.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
A signature is a virus fingerprint:

<ul>
<li>
String with  sequence of instructions specific for each virus.

</ul>
<li>
A file is infected if there is a signature inside its code

</ul>


<div id="Signatures: A Malware Countermeasure-Signatures database"><h2 id="Signatures database" class="header"><a href="#Signatures: A Malware Countermeasure-Signatures database">Signatures database</a></h2></div>
<p>
Common Malware Enumeration (CME):
</p>
<ul>
<li>
stores known malware

</ul>

<p>
=== White/ Black Listing ==
Blacklist: in computing, a blacklist is a basic access control mechanism that allows everyone access, except for the members of the black list (deny list). The opposite is a white list, which means allow nobody, except members of the white list.

<div id="Signatures: A Malware Countermeasure-Heuristic Analysis"><h2 id="Heuristic Analysis" class="header"><a href="#Signatures: A Malware Countermeasure-Heuristic Analysis">Heuristic Analysis</a></h2></div>
<ul>
<li>
Useful to identify new and "zero day" malware

<li>
Code analysis: based on the instructions, the antivirus can determine whether or not the program is malicious (program contains instruction to delete system files)

<li>
Execution emulation:

<ul>
<li>
Run code in isolated emulation

<li>
monitor actions that target file takes

<li>
if the actions are harmful, mark as virus.

</ul>
</ul>

<div id="Signatures: A Malware Countermeasure-Shield Vs On-demand"><h2 id="Shield Vs On-demand" class="header"><a href="#Signatures: A Malware Countermeasure-Shield Vs On-demand">Shield Vs On-demand</a></h2></div>
<p>
Antivirus programs
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Shield:

<ul>
<li>
Background process (service/daemon)

<li>
Scans each time a file is touched (open, copy, execute)

</ul>
<li>
On-demand:

<ul>
<li>
Scan on explicit user request or according to regular schedule.

<li>
On a suspicious file, directory, drive etc.

</ul>
<li>
To compare we can:

<ul>
<li>
comparative: check the number of already known viruses that are found and the time to perform the scan

<li>
Retrospective: test the proactive detection of the scanner for unknown viruses, to verify which vendor uses better heuristics.

</ul>
</ul>
