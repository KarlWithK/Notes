Role Based Access Control  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4NP8Eon3cA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4NP8Eon3cA</a>
	Role-Base Access Control, or RBAC for short, is the determination of what rights you have based on the role of the user. Users when created don't have any rights that unless they have a role. In a company, HR may look at a payroll, but a developer wouldn't. This system has some benefits. For example, it's very easy to add or downgrade a user to the system and get the correct rights if they change jobs. In addition, the user has the minimum rights, but can still do their job property. Linux and its group supports this system.

Cryptography for beginner <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqgtdkURzTE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqgtdkURzTE</a>
	Cryptography is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties called adversaries. Secret are done in the form of keys to turn plaintext into ciphertext. It was before physically with a briefcase. Public key cryptography features RSA to allow key exchange of the public key. Ciphers is another part of cryptography, where you shift letters. Modern, now use math. Cryptographers focus on encryption, signatures, key derivation, and hashing. Encryption comes with Asymmetric and Symmetric key systems. Hashing is where you create a representation of the value, but it cannot be reverse. Amount of collision is the factor of how good a hash function is there. Shattered is using PDFs to change the headers to make the hash match. Hash aren't useful by their selves, however, together with a key (signature) is going to verify the data. Key derivation are cyclical hashes to require computing power and thus it will be useful for passwords. Ashely madison was a site that was hacked and were able to generate everyone passwords and they were kinda important people. Good cryptography obscures data in such a way that it is difficult and costly to duplicate or reverse. Two ways to attack cryptography: brute force and cryptanalysis. Asics are applications specific integrated circuits to brute force and mine. Algorithm, system resources, iteration, and large keys are ways to stop people from brute forcing your data. Cryptanalysis is mixing the knowledge and identifying the data to get through security. Cryptography follows entropy to follow random. Computers follow instructions, randoms things are actually bug. Most services use email for the username, and people reuse passwords (top 25% can be use to bypass security). Good cryptography uses random salt to add entropy to passwords. Random salts and IVs need good random values to protect passwords. CSPRNG stands for cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generation big word. Libsodium is a good encryption and PHP has good password extension.

	Cryptography allows the security of data, personal information, and secrets. It allows communication to be secure. Specifically it refers to a set of techniques used to protect the integrity of networks, programs and data from attack, damage or unauthorized access. The message is converting the message to a cypher text and decoding it. There are two categories for cryptography as symmetric key cryptography and asymmetric key cryptography. Under symmetric there is classical, modern, transposition, stream, black, and substitution. Symmetric key cryptography is where both the sender and receiver use the same key to encrypt and decrypt a message. Data Encryption Standard (DES) is popular under the secret key cryptography. Transposition is a permeation of the master that shifts the text until it is decrypted. Substitution cipher is where the plain text is substituted by a fixed system (ROT 13). Groups of five are used because in the past messages were transmitted by telegraph. Stream cipher that encrypts each bit at a time. Modern wise, there is block cipher that uses a deterministic algorithm to encrypt a block of text. Asymmetric key cryptography is also known as public key cryptography where a user has a public and private key. The public key does the authentication, while the private decodes. Relies on computation effort required to find the private key. RSA (Rivest, Shamir, Adleman) is a common algorithm, where you calculate a bunch of numbers are the public key (e,n) and the private key(d, n).

Types of threats <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COi178UNckM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COi178UNckM</a>
	There are four types of threats to our data: Interception, Interruption, Modification, and Fabrication. Interception has to do with networks. The threat is present with "free" wifi where there is a man in the middle to steal data. Interruption describes how a system can be taken down by a denial of service attack, where there are so many requests it overwhelms the server. Next up is modification, where an attack modifies your data and can possibly delete all of the data it is attacking. Finally there fabrication: an attack that inserts new data to create an advantage to the hacker.
