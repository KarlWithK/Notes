<div id="The Ten Security Principles"><h1 id="The Ten Security Principles" class="header"><a href="#The Ten Security Principles">The Ten Security Principles</a></h1></div>

<div id="The Ten Security Principles-Economy of mechanism"><h2 id="Economy of mechanism" class="header"><a href="#The Ten Security Principles-Economy of mechanism">Economy of mechanism</a></h2></div>
<p>
This principle stresses simplicity in the design and implementation of security measures
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Everyone should be able to use it.

<li>
Even kids(?)

</ul>

<div id="The Ten Security Principles-Fail-safe defaults"><h2 id="Fail-safe defaults" class="header"><a href="#The Ten Security Principles-Fail-safe defaults">Fail-safe defaults</a></h2></div>
<p>
The principles states that the default configuration of a system should have a conservative protection scheme.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
A new user should have default that give it minimum about of rights

<li>
Web browsers have way too many right

</ul>

<div id="The Ten Security Principles-Complete Mediation"><h2 id="Complete Mediation" class="header"><a href="#The Ten Security Principles-Complete Mediation">Complete Mediation</a></h2></div>
<p>
The idea behind this principle is that every access to a resource must be checked with compliance with a protection scheme.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Be wary of techniques that save your password

</ul>

<div id="The Ten Security Principles-Open design"><h2 id="Open design" class="header"><a href="#The Ten Security Principles-Open design">Open design</a></h2></div>
<p>
The security architecture and design of a system should be made publicly available
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Security should rely only on keeping cryptographic keys secret

<li>
open design allows for a system to be scrutinized by multiple parties, which leads to the early discovery and correction of security vulnerabilities caused by design errors.

<li>
Opposite of security by obscurity, which tries to achieve security by keeping everyone secret.

</ul>

<div id="The Ten Security Principles-Separation of privilege"><h2 id="Separation of privilege" class="header"><a href="#The Ten Security Principles-Separation of privilege">Separation of privilege</a></h2></div>

Dictates that multiple conditions should be required to achieve access to restricted resources or have a program perform some actions.
</p>

<div id="The Ten Security Principles-Least Privilege"><h2 id="Least Privilege" class="header"><a href="#The Ten Security Principles-Least Privilege">Least Privilege</a></h2></div>
<p>
Each program and user of a computer system should operate with the bare minimum privilege necessary to function properly.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Abuse of privileges is restricted and any damage is minimized.

<li>
Need-to-know is a similar technique in the military.

</ul>

<div id="The Ten Security Principles-Least common Mechanism"><h2 id="Least common Mechanism" class="header"><a href="#The Ten Security Principles-Least common Mechanism">Least common Mechanism</a></h2></div>
<p>

</p>


<div id="The Ten Security Principles-Psychological acceptability"><h2 id="Psychological acceptability" class="header"><a href="#The Ten Security Principles-Psychological acceptability">Psychological acceptability</a></h2></div>
<p>
Principle states that user interfaces should be well designed and intuitive, and all security-related settings should adhere to what an ordinary user might expect.
</p>

<div id="The Ten Security Principles-Work factor"><h2 id="Work factor" class="header"><a href="#The Ten Security Principles-Work factor">Work factor</a></h2></div>
<p>
According to this principle, the cost of circumventing a security mechanism should be compared with the resources of an attackers when designing a security scheme.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Student grades don't need that much security compared to military

</ul>

<div id="The Ten Security Principles-Compromise recording"><h2 id="Compromise recording" class="header"><a href="#The Ten Security Principles-Compromise recording">Compromise recording</a></h2></div>
<p>
Sometimes it is more desirable to record the details of an intrusion than to adopt more sophisticated measures to prevent it.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Camera are better than traps sometimes to take note of the incident

<li>
Log files are nice

</ul>
