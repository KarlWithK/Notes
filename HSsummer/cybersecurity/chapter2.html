How does a Pin Tumbler Lock work?
<a href="https://youtu.be/smIdInCQ-kU">https://youtu.be/smIdInCQ-kU</a>
	I learned that the ridges on a key determine it's security, and that the most common lock is called the Pin Tumbler Lock. This specific lock works by having the plug rotate once the correct key is inputed in the keyway. The mechanism works by having springs push down the pins to be on equal levels. In order for the mechanism to work, the pins must be lined up with the shear line - if the key has the correct ridges. A master key - a key that can open any door - works by having a master pin.

[249] What Are Skeleton Keys and How Do They Work?
<a href="https://youtu.be/nV0oh40BVs4">https://youtu.be/nV0oh40BVs4</a>
	I learned the basics of skeleton keys and how they are able to pick any warden lock that it fits into. The person taught that a warded lock works as it uses physical barriers to prevent the wrong key from opening up, but a skeleton key can open all these locks. The way a skeleton key is made is by removing all the false protrusions and only leaves the ridges that open the lock. And it opens the lock just as easy as the key the lock was made for. Commercial skeleton keys are also known as a warded lock pick and they are much thinner so they can fit anywhere. If you can't open the lock with the skeleton key, then you need to pick it like you would with other lock.

A Beginner's Guide to Tubular Lock Picking
<a href="https://youtu.be/ulzZ9T2oGPE">https://youtu.be/ulzZ9T2oGPE</a>
	In this video, a person named Bryan explains to me tubular locks and how to pick them. A tubular lock picks work by having needles that allow the lock to be unlocked. The pick also has a tension wheel. The pin in the tubular pick lines up with the pin in the lock and by wiggling back and forward it unlocks the lock. The tubular lock is like a normal lock but the pins are in a tubular fashion. Spool pins are a set in a hourglass like state when picked. A cool thing about these locks is that once that pattern is done, they can be used to pick over and over the same confirmation. This can be used to get a new key.

[91] How To Scrub Your First Lock Open With Half Diamond
<a href="https://youtu.be/Uj3Cy0c-nyU">https://youtu.be/Uj3Cy0c-nyU</a>
	I learned that to pick a lock there are techniques you must do. The half diamond is a very useful tool. First you put the bottom of the keyway tensioner to create tension, and then you just "scrub" until the lock opens ones. And that's basically it. The same techniques can be used for multiple locks even with residential locks. It is very versatile and very easy. The scrubbing works by just getting the pins to be in place, and by doing it enough it will unlock the whole lock.

Pick a Lock in SECONDS with a Bump Key
<a href="https://youtu.be/WpH_t0u5Ybg">https://youtu.be/WpH_t0u5Ybg</a>
	Brian and his show demonstrate to me any lock I buy in a day to day store is useless to any serious security. Even an expensive lock might be easy to pick. The cylinder is the part that has all the parts: including the pins. A bump key works by not completing putting in the key in, and then bumping (hitting) it until all the pins are in the shear line and unlock it. You can buy a set of bump keys for $8. You can also make your own key by filing the key, but people don't usually sell blanks. In combination with the key, you can use an O ring to create the spacing needed. The technique relies on the turning. The industry standard is 5 ridges. Schlage is a great lock that makes it bump proof with two locking points.
