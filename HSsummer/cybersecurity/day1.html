Avoidance of the unauthorized disclosure of information. Protection of data and only allow those who need it - others are blocked.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Only students can check their own grades. Teachers can do so

<ul>
<li>
Encryption: the transformation of information using a secret called an encryption key, so that the transformed information can only be read using another secret, called the decryption key.

<ul>
<li>
Hackers usually "hack" during the communication channel.

<li>
Encrypt -&gt; encode file

<li>
decrypt -&gt; decode file using key.

<li>
Cipher -&gt; means encrypted

</ul>
<li>
Access control: Rules and policies that limit access to confidential information to those people and/or systems with a "need to know":

<ul>
<li>
Determined by identity and which role they play.

<li>
Linux groups (i.e. wheel group)

</ul>
<li>
Authentication: the determination of the identity or role that someone has.

<ul>
<li>
Can be determined using a feature a person has like smart card, password or fingerprint.

</ul>
<li>
Authorization: the determination if a person or system is allowed access to resources, based on an access control. Prevent attackers from tricking the system to have access to files.

<li>
Physical security: the establishment of physical barriers to limit access to protected computation resources:

<ul>
<li>
Lock, Cabinets, walls with copper meshes (Faraday Cages).

<li>
Keyboard has a wire with electromagnetic signal -&gt; could be read.

</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Backups: the periodic archiving of data.

<li>
Checksums: the computation of a function that maps the contents of a file to a numerical value. A checksum function depends on the entire contents of a file and is designed in a way that even a small change to the input file will result in a different output value.

<li>
Data correcting codes: methods for storing data in such a way that small changes be easily detected and automatically corrected.

</ul>

<div id="Terms-Availability"><h2 id="Availability" class="header"><a href="#Terms-Availability">Availability</a></h2></div>

</p>
<ul>
<li>
Trust management depends on:

<ul>
<li>
Policies -&gt; specify behavioral expectation that people or systems have for themselves and others.

<li>
Permissions, which describe the behaviors that are allowed by the agents that interacts with a person or system.

<li>
Protections: Describe mechanisms put in place to enforce permissions and  policies.

</ul>
</ul>

<div id="Other security concepts-Authenticity"><h2 id="Authenticity" class="header"><a href="#Other security concepts-Authenticity">Authenticity</a></h2></div>
<p>
The ability to determine that statements, policies, and permissions issued by person or systems are genuine.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Digital signatures: Cryptographic computations that allow a person or system to commit to the authenticity of their documents in a unique way that achieves nonrepudiation, which is the property that authentic statements issued by some person or system cannot be denied.

</ul>

<div id="Other security concepts-Anonymity"><h2 id="Anonymity" class="header"><a href="#Other security concepts-Anonymity">Anonymity</a></h2></div>
<p>

<ul>
<li>
Aggregation: the combining of data from many individual so that disclosed sums or averages cannot be tied to any individual.

<li>
Mixing, the interlining go transactions, information, or communications in a way that cannot be traced to any individual.

<li>
Proxies: trusted agents that are willing to engage in actions for individual in a way that cannot be traced back to that person.

<li>
Pseudonyms: fictional identities that can fill in for real identities in communications and transaction, but are otherwise known only to a trusted entity.
