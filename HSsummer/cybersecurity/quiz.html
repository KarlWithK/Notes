Quiz # 1 				CSN 100		    	Summer  2020
Name: 	Carlos Hernandez..	ID #  24122307..

<p>
Question # 1: What is a Masquerading attack?
A masquerading attack is when an individual fabricates information by pretending to be someone else with a fake identity. This allows the attacker to gain unauthorized access to a person's information or change data. 
</p>

<p>
Question # 2: What does it mean for a system to have fail-safe default?
When a system has "fail-safe defaults" it means that the users have bare minimum rights to use the operating system/computer. The correct terminology would be to say that a system has a conservative protection scheme. An example of this would be users having rights to read files, but sometimes not being able to execute or write to them.
</p>

<p>
Question # 3 What is Encryption and Decryption? Explain with example.
Encryption is the transformation of information using an encryption key that can allow be read using a decryption key. The encrypted information is then called cipher text. Decryption is the transformation of cipher text into plaintext using the decryption key. An example of this is when I send a message on gmail, google encrypts it using TLS to secure my message. Finally, when the correct address is found, gmail (google) decrypts it using their own decryption key to get the plaintext (and html of the email).
</p>

<p>
Question # 4: What is a Symmetric Cryptosystem? 
Symmetric key cryptography is where both the sender and receiver use the same key to encrypt and decrypt a message. This is also private key system, and to find out the number of keys needed you use the formula n(n-1) /2, where n is the number of users.
</p>

<p>
Question # 5: What is the difference between Public and Private Keys, which type of key is used for Digital Signature?
The difference between public and private keys is that you encrypt with the public key, and decrypt with your private key. Additionally, you distribute your public key to others, but they keep their own private key. Digital signatures is part of asymmetric cryptography and it uses the user's private key to encrypt a signature. 
</p>

<p>
Question # 6:  What is Authentication?  And explain three common factors for authentication. Give at least three examples.
Authentication is "the determination of the identity or role that someone has". The three common factors to determine the identity of a person are questions about a person's property (smart card), knowledge (knowing their password), or a feature of a person (fingerprints). 
</p>

<p>
Question # 7: What type of techniques the criminal can use to destroy evidence on a computer?
A criminal can use a Degauser magnetic field, shredder, terminate, or wipe the disk clean to destroy the evidence on a computer. Degauser magnetic field destroys can destroy the hard drive, and the wiping the disk clean destroys the bits in the drive.
