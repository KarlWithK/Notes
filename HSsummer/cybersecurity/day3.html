<div id="Authentication"><h1 id="Authentication" class="header"><a href="#Authentication">Authentication</a></h1></div>
<p>
Determination of identity.
</p>

<div id="Authentication-Barcodes"><h2 id="Barcodes" class="header"><a href="#Authentication-Barcodes">Barcodes</a></h2></div>
<ul>
<li>
Made in 20th century for grocery checkout

<li>
First gen represents data as a series of variable-width, vertical lines of link. Encoding shame.

<li>
Later become 2D and have been used in airline

<li>
Provides convenience but not security as they are easy to duplicate

</ul>

<div id="Authentication-Magnetic Stripe Cards"><h2 id="Magnetic Stripe Cards" class="header"><a href="#Authentication-Magnetic Stripe Cards">Magnetic Stripe Cards</a></h2></div>
<p>
Plastic card with a magnetic stripe containing information about the owner.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The first track of the card contains name of the cardholder and other data

<li>
The second track contains discretionary data.

</ul>

<div id="Authentication-Magnetic Stripe Cards-Security"><h3 id="Security" class="header"><a href="#Authentication-Magnetic Stripe Cards-Security">Security</a></h3></div>
<ul>
<li>
Vulnerable due to the medium being easy to read and reproduce

<li>
magnetic stripe reads can be purchased at low cost making it easy to read information

<li>
With magnetic stripe writer an attacker can easily clone a card.

<li>
PIN is needed in addition with the card

</ul>

<div id="Authentication-Smart Cards"><h2 id="Smart Cards" class="header"><a href="#Authentication-Smart Cards">Smart Cards</a></h2></div>
<p>
Cards that have an integrated circuit with a microprocessor that allowing altering and reading of the data. Is better than magnetic cards.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Strong authentication that uses cryptography and used by large companies.

<li>
Electronic wallet. Debit card.

</ul>

<div id="Authentication-SIM Cards"><h2 id="SIM Cards" class="header"><a href="#Authentication-SIM Cards">SIM Cards</a></h2></div>
<p>
SIM stands for Subscriber identity module card.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Issued by a network provider and contains information of the owner to allow access to a cellular network.

</ul>

<div id="Authentication-SIM Cards-Security"><h3 id="Security" class="header"><a href="#Authentication-SIM Cards-Security">Security</a></h3></div>
<ul>
<li>
Has a lot of information to authenticate to the approbate network

<li>
Network provider has a record of the card

<li>
Features Integrated Circuit Card ID (ICCID) which is a 18-digit number used for hardware identification.

<li>
Has a international mobile subscriber identity (IMSI) -&gt; more info about owner

<li>
Contains a 128-bit secret key that is use for authentication.

<li>
Some have a pin to access all the data.

</ul>

<div id="Authentication-GSM Challenge-Response Protocol"><h2 id="GSM Challenge-Response Protocol" class="header"><a href="#Authentication-GSM Challenge-Response Protocol">GSM Challenge-Response Protocol</a></h2></div>
<ul>
<li>
Cellphone connects to a local base station and transmits its IMSI to connect to a cellular network.

<li>
The phone will recieve a 128-bit random number to the cellphone, which is ended ed by the SIM Card's secret key using an algorithm called A3.

<li>
Results in a ciphertext that are computed in both the phone and the base station and if they match the cell phone is allowed to make calls.

</ul>

<div id="Authentication-RFIDs"><h2 id="RFIDs" class="header"><a href="#Authentication-RFIDs">RFIDs</a></h2></div>
<p>
Radio frequency identification (RFID) relies on small transponders to transmit identification information via radio waves.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
RFID chips have an integrated circuit and a coiled antenna to transmit and receive a radio signal.

<li>
RFID tags must be used with a separate reader or writer. Some which may need a battery

<li>
Range of RFID varies but it most cases a tag doesn't need to be closed to the reader.

<li>
Many applications like consumer-product tracking, Car key fobs, or electronic toll transponders.

<li>
Passports have an RFID chip that contains a digital facial photograph:

<ul>
<li>
RFID messages are also encrypted with a secret key 

<li>
Usually the key is the passport number, the holder's date of birth, and the expiration date. -&gt; Usually on the passport itself since the key is intended to be accessible physically only

<li>
However an attacker can take this information using social engineering.

</ul>
</ul>

<div id="Authentication-Biometrics"><h2 id="Biometrics" class="header"><a href="#Authentication-Biometrics">Biometrics</a></h2></div>
<p>
Any measure used to identity a person based on biological traits.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Contains a sensor or scanner to read in information and compare it to a database of accepted users.

</ul>

<div id="Authentication-Biometrics-Requirements"><h3 id="Requirements" class="header"><a href="#Authentication-Biometrics-Requirements">Requirements</a></h3></div>
<ul>
<li>
Universality: every person should have this characteristic

<li>
Distinctiveness, each person should have differences on said traits

<li>
Permanence: Trait should not change over time.

<li>
Collectability: Should have some quantitative aspect and should be determine quickly.

<li>
Biometric goes through the reader and is converted into a feature vector, which is compared with a reference vector.

</ul>

<div id="Authentication-Biometrics-Candidates for biometric IDs"><h3 id="Candidates for biometric IDs" class="header"><a href="#Authentication-Biometrics-Candidates for biometric IDs">Candidates for biometric IDs</a></h3></div>
<ul>
<li>
Fingerprints

<li>
Retina

<li>
DNA

<li>
‘Blue ink” sign.

</ul>
