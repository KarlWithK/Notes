<p>
Malware can be classified into multiple categories, depending on propagation and concealment.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Propagation:

<ul>
<li>
Virus: human-assisted propagation (open email attachment)

<li>
work: automatic propagation without human assistance

</ul>
<li>
Concealment:

<ul>
<li>
Rootkit: modifies OS to hide its existence

<li>
Trojan: provides desirable functionality but hide malicious operation.

</ul>
<li>
Various types of payloads, ranging from annoyance to crime.

</ul>

<div id="Propagation-Insider Attacks"><h2 id="Insider Attacks" class="header"><a href="#Propagation-Insider Attacks">Insider Attacks</a></h2></div>
<p>
An insider attack is a security breach that is caused or facilitated by someone who is part of the very organization that controls or builds the asset that should Br protected
</p>

<div id="Propagation-Backdoors"><h2 id="Backdoors" class="header"><a href="#Propagation-Backdoors">Backdoors</a></h2></div>
<p>
Sometimes called a trapdoor, and it is a hidden feature or command in a program that allows a user to perform action they would normally not be allowed to do
</p>
<ul>
<li>
When hidden feature is activated, the program does something unexpected, like giving more permissions to a user

</ul>

<div id="Propagation-Logic Bombs"><h2 id="Logic Bombs" class="header"><a href="#Propagation-Logic Bombs">Logic Bombs</a></h2></div>
<p>
A logic bomb is a program that performs a malicious action as a result of a certain logic condition.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Example is when a programmer codes the software for the payroll system so it has to pay him.

<li>
Or when a programmer codes in that the program crashes when it is reaches a certain day.

</ul>

<div id="Propagation-Logic Bombs-The Omega Bomb Code"><h3 id="The Omega Bomb Code" class="header"><a href="#Propagation-Logic Bombs-The Omega Bomb Code">The Omega Bomb Code</a></h3></div>
<p>
A person destroyed his company by using a logic bomb on 7/30/96. Deleted critical information.
</p>


<div id="Propagation-Defenses against insider Attacks"><h2 id="Defenses against insider Attacks" class="header"><a href="#Propagation-Defenses against insider Attacks">Defenses against insider Attacks</a></h2></div>
<ul>
<li>
Avoid single points of failure

<li>
Use code walk-throughs

<li>
Use archiving and reporting tools

<li>
Limit authority and  permissions

<li>
Physically secure critical systems

<li>
Monitor employee behavior

<li>
Control

</ul>

<div id="Propagation-Computer Viruses"><h2 id="Computer Viruses" class="header"><a href="#Propagation-Computer Viruses">Computer Viruses</a></h2></div>
<p>
A computer virus is computer code that can replicate itself by modifying other files or programs to insert code that is capable of further replication
</p>
<ul>
<li>
This property is what distinguishes computer viruses from other kinds of Malware.

<li>
Another feature is that replication requires.

</ul>

<div id="Propagation-Biological Analogy"><h2 id="Biological Analogy" class="header"><a href="#Propagation-Biological Analogy">Biological Analogy</a></h2></div>
<p>
Computer viruses share some properties with biological versus like replication.
</p>

<div id="Propagation-Biological Analogy-Virus Phases"><h3 id="Virus Phases" class="header"><a href="#Propagation-Biological Analogy-Virus Phases">Virus Phases</a></h3></div>
<p>
Many phases a virus goes in:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Dormant: just exists and avoids detection

<li>
Propagation phase: replicates itself

<li>
Triggering: some logical condition causes the birus to be activated.

<li>
Action phase: performs all actions it was designed to perform (payload):

<ul>
<li>
could be innocent or not.

</ul>
</ul>

<div id="Propagation-Infection types"><h2 id="Infection types" class="header"><a href="#Propagation-Infection types">Infection types</a></h2></div>
<ul>
<li>
Overwriting: destroys original code

<li>
Pre-pending: keeps original code, possibly compressed

<li>
Infection of libraries: allows virus to be memory resident like kernel32.dll

<li>
Macro viruses: Infects MS office documents (often installs in main document template).

</ul>

<div id="Concealment"><h1 id="Concealment" class="header"><a href="#Concealment">Concealment</a></h1></div>
<ul>
<li>
Encrypeted virus:

<ul>
<li>
Virus that encrypts its payload to make it more hard to detect. However, an antivirus can use a derptor to deactivate it.

<li>
Polymorphic virus

<li>
Encrypted virus with random variations of the decrption engine

<li>
Detection using CPU emulator

</ul>
<li>
Metamorphic virus:

<ul>
<li>
A type of malware that is capable of changing its code and signature patterns with each iteration. Considered to more advance threats than typical malware or even polymorphic viruses.

</ul>
</ul>

<div id="Concealment-Computer Worms"><h2 id="Computer Worms" class="header"><a href="#Concealment-Computer Worms">Computer Worms</a></h2></div>
<p>
A computer worm is a malware program that spreads copies of itself without the need to inject itself.
</p>


<div id="Concealment-Computer Worms-Worm Propagation"><h3 id="Worm Propagation" class="header"><a href="#Concealment-Computer Worms-Worm Propagation">Worm Propagation</a></h3></div>
<p>
Propagation by finding and infection vulnerable hosts.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Need a way to tell if a host is vulnerable or already infected

<li>
Propagation theory: Classic epidemic model

</ul>
