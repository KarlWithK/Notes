CSN 100, or Introduction to cybersecurity, is an elementary level class where we learn the most basics of security. As it's name suggests, the class introduces concerns and solutions of security in computers - both digitally and physically. Although the class only teaches at a surface level on various topics, it has definitely played a great role in teaching me what goes behind the concepts of a user interface when using a computer.
</p>

<p>
In fact, the more I learned the more I gathered that computers can be more secure, yet the only thing that is binding this process is users' preference. As I mentioned before, the class deals with both physical and software components. The purpose of security in general is to make sure the user's data is confidential, is available, and only given to the user. These are the three goals of security: confidentiality, Integrity of the user, and Availability.
</p>

<p>
To make sure a user's data is physically secure, we came up with methods and algorithms to make sure data is encrypted. We came up with cryptosystems to make sure our data is sent to the correct person. Nowadays, the way our data is stored and how it is sent is full of protocols. Ranging from digital handshakes, how our file system is built around, how passwords are stored, or even the designs of our systems to authenticate users demonstrate humans have come up with systems to ensure a sufficient amount of security digitally.
</p>

<p>
Physically, as well, we have come up with locks, barcodes, and biometric methods to make sure our data is secured. Credit cards are a prime example of the technology we have to ensure that is the case. We store computers in safe locations to enforce the idea of security.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately - and this is the reason we have security in the first place, some people want your data. We call these peeps attackers, and they have various methods to attack us and get our data. Ranging from physically being there to steal your computer, to intercepting a message, manipulating you to say your passwords, or even lockpicking your computer - honestly, it would be very easy for an attacker to steal your data.
</p>

<p>
To combat this we have come up with the aforementioned strategies to protect our data. Nonetheless, in case a situation comes up where we need to find the attacker, we can use computer forensics to determine what occurred.
</p>

<p>
Overall, cybersecurity is without a question a class I would recommend to others as it speaks volume over how much is going underneath a simple message to a friend. It also demonstrates how much cybersecurity can be advanced, if users would realize how easy exploits can occur.
