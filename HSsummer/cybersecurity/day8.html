<p>
The action of loading an operating system into memory from a powered-off state is known as booting or bootstraping.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
When a computer is turned on, it first executes code stored in BIOS (basic input/output system)

<li>
BIOS loads into memory the second-stage boot loader, which handles loading the rest of the OS into memory and then passes control to the OS

</ul>

<div id="Operating System Security-BIOS Passwords"><h2 id="BIOS Passwords" class="header"><a href="#Operating System Security-BIOS Passwords">BIOS Passwords</a></h2></div>
<p>
A malicious user could potentially seize exaction of a computer at server points.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
To prevent this, many computers have a BIOS password that does not allow a second-stage boot leader without authentication.

</ul>

<div id="Operating System Security-Hibernation"><h2 id="Hibernation" class="header"><a href="#Operating System Security-Hibernation">Hibernation</a></h2></div>
<p>
Computers can go into a powered-off state known as hibernation
</p>
<ul>
<li>
While in this state, the OS stores the contents of machine's memory into a hibernation file (such as hiberfil.sys) so it restore everything

<li>
Exposes a machine to potentially invasive forensic investigation.

</ul>

<div id="Operating System Security-Event logging"><h2 id="Event logging" class="header"><a href="#Operating System Security-Event logging">Event logging</a></h2></div>
<p>
Logs keep track of all process are running, Internet aces, crashes: for the purpose of troubleshooting and determining the cause of a security breach.
</p>

<div id="Operating System Security-Memory and Filesystem Security"><h2 id="Memory and Filesystem Security" class="header"><a href="#Operating System Security-Memory and Filesystem Security">Memory and Filesystem Security</a></h2></div>
<p>
The contents of a computer are encapsulated in its memory and Filesystem.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Thus, protection of a computer's contents has to start with the protection of its memory and Filesystem.

</ul>


<div id="Operating System Security-Password Security"><h2 id="Password Security" class="header"><a href="#Operating System Security-Password Security">Password Security</a></h2></div>
<p>
The basic approach to guessing passwords from password file is to conduct a dictionary attack, where each word in a dictionary is hashed and the resulting value is compared with the hashed passwords in the password file.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
A dictionary of 500k words is enough to discover most passwords

</ul>

<div id="Operating System Security-Password Salt"><h2 id="Password Salt" class="header"><a href="#Operating System Security-Password Salt">Password Salt</a></h2></div>
<p>
Use "salt", which is associated with a random number with each userID.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Rather than comparing the has of an entered password, the system compares the hash an entered password and the salt for the associated userid.

</ul>

<div id="Operating System Security-Password Salt-How Salt increases search space size"><h3 id="How Salt increases search space size" class="header"><a href="#Operating System Security-Password Salt-How Salt increases search space size">How Salt increases search space size</a></h3></div>
<p>
Increase search space for dictionary attack on a solted password is of size 2<sup><small>B</small></sup>*D. About 2 quadrillion. Where B is the number of bits of the random salt and D.
