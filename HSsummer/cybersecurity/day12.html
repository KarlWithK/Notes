<p>
IP is Internet Protocol and TCP is Transmission Control Protocol
</p>

<div id="Networks: IP and TCP-Internet Protocol"><h2 id="Internet Protocol" class="header"><a href="#Networks: IP and TCP-Internet Protocol">Internet Protocol</a></h2></div>
<p>
Connectionless:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Each packet is transported independently from other packets

</ul>
<p>
Unreliable:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Delivery on a best effor basis

<li>
No acknowledgments

<li>
Packets may be lost, reordered, corrupted, or duplicated

</ul>
<p>
IP packets:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Encapsulate TCP and UDP

<li>
Encapsulated into link-layer frame

</ul>


<div id="Networks: IP and TCP-Internet Protocol-IP Address and Packets"><h3 id="IP Address and Packets" class="header"><a href="#Networks: IP and TCP-Internet Protocol-IP Address and Packets">IP Address and Packets</a></h3></div>
<p>
IP address come in either 32-bit address (IPV4) and IPv6 (128-bit address)
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Address subdivided into network, subnet, and host.

<li>
Broadcast address -&gt; 128.148.32.255

<li>
Private networks:

<ul>
<li>
not routed outside of a LAN

</ul>
<li>
IP header includes:

<ul>
<li>
Source address

<li>
Destination address

<li>
Packet length (ip to 64KB)

<li>
Time to live (up to 255)

<li>
IP protocol version

<li>
Fragmentation information: how many packets

<li>
Transport layer protocol information

</ul>
</ul>

<div id="Networks: IP and TCP-Internet Protocol-IP Address Space and ICANN"><h3 id="IP Address Space and ICANN" class="header"><a href="#Networks: IP and TCP-Internet Protocol-IP Address Space and ICANN">IP Address Space and ICANN</a></h3></div>
<p>
Hosts on the Internet must have unique IP addresses
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers:

<ul>

<p>
Most universities separate their network connecting dorms and the network connecting offices and academic buildings
</p>

<div id="Networks: IP and TCP-Internet Protocol-IP routing"><h3 id="IP routing" class="header"><a href="#Networks: IP and TCP-Internet Protocol-IP routing">IP routing</a></h3></div>
<p>
A router bridges two or more networks:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Operates at the network layer

<li>
Maintains tables to forward packets to the appropriate network

<li>
Forwarding decisions based solely on the destination address

</ul>
<li>
Routing table:

<ul>
<li>
Maps ranges of addresses to LANs or other gateway routers

</ul>

<div id="Networks: IP and TCP-Internet Protocol-Internet Routes"><h3 id="Internet Routes" class="header"><a href="#Networks: IP and TCP-Internet Protocol-Internet Routes">Internet Routes</a></h3></div>
<p>
Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Used for network testing and debugging

<li>
Simple messages encapsulated in single IP packets

<li>
Considered a network layer protocol

</ul>
<li>
Tools based on ICMP

<ul>
<li>
Ping: sends series of echo request messages and provides statics on routtrip time and packets loss

<li>
Tracceroute: sends series ICMP packets with increasing TTL value to discover problems

</ul>


<div id="Networks: IP and TCP-ICMP attacks"><h2 id="ICMP attacks" class="header"><a href="#Networks: IP and TCP-ICMP attacks">ICMP attacks</a></h2></div>
<ul>
<li>
Ping of death:

<ul>
<li>
ICMP specifies messages must fir a single IP packet (64kb)

<li>
send a ping packet that exceeds maxim size using IP fragmentation

<li>
Resembled packet caused several operating systems to crash due to a buffer overflow

</ul>
<li>
Smurf:

<ul>
<li>
Ping a broadcast address using a spoofed source address

</ul>
</ul>

<div id="Networks: IP and TCP-IP Vulnerabilities"><h2 id="IP Vulnerabilities" class="header"><a href="#Networks: IP and TCP-IP Vulnerabilities">IP Vulnerabilities</a></h2></div>
<ul>
<li>
Unencrypted transmssion:

<ul>
<li>
eavesdropping possible at any intermediate host during routing

</ul>
<li>
No source Authentication:

<ul>
<li>
sender can spoof source address, making it difficult, making it difficult to trace back to attacker

</ul>
<li>
No integrity checking:

<ul>
<li>
Entire packet, header and payload can be modified while en route to destination, enabling content forgeries, redirections, and man-in-the-middle attacks

</ul>
<li>
No bandwidth constraints:

<ul>
<li>
Large number of packets can be injected into network to lauch a denial-of-service attack

<li>
Broadcast address provide additional leverage

</ul>
</ul>

<div id="Networks: IP and TCP-Denial of service Attack"><h2 id="Denial of service Attack" class="header"><a href="#Networks: IP and TCP-Denial of service Attack">Denial of service Attack</a></h2></div>
<p>
Send large number of packet to host to slow down or crash host
</p>
<ul>
<li>
often executed by botnet

<li>
long for DoS

<li>
IP source spoofing:

<ul>
<li>
hides attacker

<li>
Scatters return traffic from victim

</ul>
</ul>

<div id="Networks: IP and TCP-IP traceback"><h2 id="IP traceback" class="header"><a href="#Networks: IP and TCP-IP traceback">IP traceback</a></h2></div>
<p>
Someone is a DoS attack
Solutions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Filtering and tracing (immediate reaction)

<li>
Messaging (additional traffic)

<li>
logging (additional storage)

</ul>

<div id="Networks: IP and TCP-IP traceback-Probabilistic marking"><h3 id="Probabilistic marking" class="header"><a href="#Networks: IP and TCP-IP traceback-Probabilistic marking">Probabilistic marking</a></h3></div>
<p>
Method:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
random injection of information into packet header

<li>
Changes seldom used bits

<li>
forward routing information to victim

<li>
Redundancy to survive packet losses

</ul>
<p>
Benefits:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
No additional traffic

<li>
No router Storage

<li>
No packet size increase

<li>
Can be performed online or offline

</ul>
