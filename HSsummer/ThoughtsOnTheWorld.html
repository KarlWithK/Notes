Thoughts on the world. Excuse me for my grammar. This is a rant tbh.
</p>

<p>
2020 has been an extremely difficult year for many. Yet, as the popular saying goes, "history repeats itself", and indeed, 2020 was a repetition of many past events in new clothes. I think what was most impacting out of this whole school year was the second semester of US History: from the 1920s to the civil rights movement. As I started to learn about the events that have transpired in the past, I was mocking people for being so stupid to not see the signs of disaster. Yet, in the past few months it has become clear to me that people in the future will be mocking us.

Funnily enough, when seatbelts were first invented people proclaimed that they "ineffective, inconvenient, and uncomfortable" (<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/when-americans-went-to-war-against-seat-belts-2020-5).">https://www.businessinsider.com/when-americans-went-to-war-against-seat-belts-2020-5).</a> Yet, one of the first things that my Dad told me when he taught me how to drive was to always put on the belt as soon as I get into the car. It wasn't worth risking your life over a slight discomfort he insisted. However, just like Americans at first refused to wear seatbelts, they are still refusing to wear masks. As the person who often buys the grocery for my family, it's surprising how many people put them on, then immediately take them off when they get in the store. It's quite disgusting.

Recently, there has been a survey asking whether a student will go to school or have remote learning. And to my surprise there is a decent amount of people who want a blended model. I can't blame them as I agree with some of their reasoning, but the more I believe that people should choose remote. Why? Simple, studies have shown that kids spread "more efficiently" than adults (<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2768952?utm_source=undefined&amp;utm_campaign=content-shareicons&amp;utm_content=article_engagement&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_term=073020#.XyNyImjnx-k.email).">https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2768952?utm_source=undefined&amp;utm_campaign=content-shareicons&amp;utm_content=article_engagement&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_term=073020#.XyNyImjnx-k.email).</a> I want to go to school too, but it will definitely make this situation worse. Furthermore, as a person who takes cares of his nephews for an hour every day, I have seen enough to determine that they will not stop touching you. And even if kids are safer than adults in terms of death, the truth is that you can still die. And this thing will spread, and it can get to your parents. Trust me, you do not want that to happen.

My stepdad is a great man, and ever since I was 5 he has raised me as his own. Even when his relationship with my mom fell apart, he still cared for me and came to see me every weekend. At this point, I can only address him as my Dad because that is what he is. Unfortunately, when the pandemic hit New York City, he was one of the people who got hit first and the hardest. He quickly developed pneumonia and lost his voice. And for a week, he stopped contacting my family and I. He didn't want me to listen to his condition. At one point in March, I snuck out of my house to see him because it was his birthday. He was 48, lived alone, and had no job. I felt it was my duty to check on him and his condition. I understand I was selfish, but I could not wait around. Thankfully to my relief he was sick, but fighting strong. Eventually, in the span of a month he got better and gained his voice back. I was so glad when I finally got to see him in late March and when he started to answer my calls back.

I was fortune enough for my dad to survive and up and running within two months. Unfortunately, I know some people won't be as lucky, and lives will be lost. Truthfully speaking, we aren't even done with wave 1, yet people want kids and teachers to risk their lives... I just can't understand it. People should not take the risk. In fact in Israel, they brought back schools, and see how that turned out (<a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/606220551719223336/739176042945839174/58MInFS.png)!">https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/606220551719223336/739176042945839174/58MInFS.png)!</a> Wait...actually, you don't need to look that far! Here is Georgia in their first week: <a href="https://preview.redd.it/sp44ts8rize51.jpg?width=576&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aa9580f0a429e2a518afbe66e7a5078f8092ed44.">https://preview.redd.it/sp44ts8rize51.jpg?width=576&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aa9580f0a429e2a518afbe66e7a5078f8092ed44.</a> Wow! Many masks! Very safe.

I guess the other big American topic to talk about is Civil rights and police brutality. I had some notes and thoughts I wanted to put out on the various protests, but I feel like there are other posts that better convey all the sentiment relating to those current events. However, it's quite interesting to me that even in places like Hong Kong there are similar issues of Police attacking the people who they were supposed to protect. No matter their excuses, at the end of the day there is visible oppression of human rights.

<p>
Well it's not like any real government is seriously making sure groups don't violate human rights. I mean look at China and the Uighurs Muslims in literal concentration camps (<a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1310797/China-cover-up-Beijing-Xi-Jinping-Uighurs-US-tensions-drone-footage-latest).">https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1310797/China-cover-up-Beijing-Xi-Jinping-Uighurs-US-tensions-drone-footage-latest).</a> No seriously, there is a literal holocaust happening right now, and nothing is happening. Remember in 10th grade, when we talked about WW2 and the definition of a genocide? Well, it's happening right under our noses. Talking about noses and the human body, did you know that there are various claims that the Chinese government is harvesting organs from this group (<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/china-harvesting-organs-of-uighur-muslims-china-tribunal-tells-un-2019-9?op=1)?">https://www.businessinsider.com/china-harvesting-organs-of-uighur-muslims-china-tribunal-tells-un-2019-9?op=1)?</a> Not even their hair is safe! (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/01/china-muslim-labor-camps-uighur-hair-products).">https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/01/china-muslim-labor-camps-uighur-hair-products).</a> It's absolutely disgusting to think that we won't do anything to help them. I thought our president was anti-china, then why isn't he calling them out for being savages that steal people's organs? Oh, he only does calls out Blacks, Latinos, and other minorities? Oh, my bad.
</p>

<p>
Look. Even if we don't want to talk about it, we have to. Prisoners are humans too, yet there are some prisons where the coronavirus is about 75% (<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/jul/23/federal-prison-had-75-coronavirus-infection-rate/)!">https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/jul/23/federal-prison-had-75-coronavirus-infection-rate/)!</a> And may I remind you that these are our citizens. What about non-citizens? Well, it turns out that the ICE detention "centers" have about hella cases too (<a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/immigration/news/2020/06/16/486338/data-coronavirus-outbreak-immigration-detention-offer-questions-answers/)!">https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/immigration/news/2020/06/16/486338/data-coronavirus-outbreak-immigration-detention-offer-questions-answers/)!</a> And there are children who will die. This isn't the first time a camp is happening, there have been multiple camps during WW2 for Asians. Even now, people are harassing Asians. No wait...now the president himself is promoting the blame towards our Asian American citizens.
</p>

<p>
At the end of the day, America doesn't care about human rights. It only pretends to and only when it is forced to. Only who is to blame? Well us, who don't vote. Us, who learn science only to reject it when it is not convenient for our goals. Us, who only protest when we are suffering. America is a democracy, and somehow we voted ourselves into this position.
