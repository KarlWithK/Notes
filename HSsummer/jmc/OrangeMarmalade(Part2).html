Part 2:
Back in 2013, I had no idea that webtoons were a thing. In fact, until 2 years ago, I didn't realized how big and huge they have become and webtoons.com was at the center of all this. Yet, when I visted the site, I was shocked to see that people were reading translations of "manga" that had finished translations 5 years before. Orange Marmalade was one of these comics that gain fame, yet, was already finished being translated. At the end of the day, hover, I realized that it was amazing that such a story was revived as it was one of my favorite romcoms.
</p>

<p>
Don't get me wrong the characters by themselves where nothing special nor the main romance story was all that great. In all honestly, it was a simple case of boy chases girl, drama happens, <span id="Orange Marmalade-blah blah"></span><strong id="blah blah">blah blah</strong> and <span id="Orange Marmalade-boom"></span><strong id="boom">boom</strong> happy ending! The thing that really lured me into this comic and kept me enjoying rereading it was the world. The story revolves around the relationship of Ma Ri and Jae Min, but there is a catch - Ma Ri is a vampire. Yes, this is a stereotypical vampire-human relationship, and, while the concept isn't anything new, I would say that it's the perfect story to relate to.
</p>

<p>
In one way or another, most of you have experienced being harassed for being out of place. It's something that unfortunately happens a lot. Here you can picture it: you are quite different from the rest, and you get critiqued or even bullied. Ma Ri is the one who is out of place. Ma Ri is a vampire, but is forced to keep this fact hidden due to fear of normal humans. Her only wish is to spend high school in peace and get by life. However, due to <span id="Orange Marmalade-plot that I won't spoil"></span><strong id="plot that I won't spoil">plot that I won't spoil</strong> and the how vampires are treated in her world, she is placed in a position where she is forced to lie about her identify. She is forced to sit in the bathroom alone and have no friends. She is forced to pretend that everything will be okay. This is what makes this story relatable: her own self hated and the extent she goes to live life peacefully despite the situation she is in.
</p>

<p>
Everyone has troubles. And, unfortunately, sometimes we can't change the situation we are in. I believe what makes Orange Marmalade so great, is the fact that it describes the journey of how Ma Ri came to accept her situation and live with it. No. She didn't just "accept" her situation, at the end she was proud of herself. I believe that it is a manhwa that can help people visualize what a person might be going through. It embeds into you that always have help and love from friends despite how bad your situation is. And best of all: replace vampire with any group that is being targeted today, and I'm sure you will be able to see just how badly said group is being misinterpreted and treated.
</p>

<p>
Orange Marmalade is a story that once you finish reading it will make you a kinder person. Also, it's worth noting that the art is pretty cute. Furthermore, while the romance is pretty vanilla, it's still nice and keeps my fluffy levels up.
</p>

<p>
TL;DR it's good shit, quite fluffy, makes you a kinder person, and it makes me cry.
