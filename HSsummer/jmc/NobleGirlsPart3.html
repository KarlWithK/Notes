Part 3:
</p>

<p>
A bitch. A wise vixen. A motherfucking villainess. If you tried to insult Aria with any of these words, do you know what she would do? She would pretend to cry, "run away", and then begin her plan. A pretty simple one: she would make sure to get every bit of information she can get about you, start spreading rumors, pretend she is your friend, have the kingdom go against you, and then finally kill you silently, This is the type of person Aria Roscent is...plus more.
</p>

<p>
At this point, many probably know the trope of "Villainess girl gets reborn to make sure she doesn't die a horrible death" or the genre "Noble Girls" that describes this trope. With the release of Otome Game and the main character Bakarina, anime watchers have finally gotten their first taste of this genre...and I believe that more are to come. I have been one of the early followers of this genre and I love it...except for one tiny problem: they are basically the same fucking novel. Don't get me wrong, some are better than others in terms of writing, but they pretty much follow the concept really strongly. A girl is being harassed (in the future)/ somehow gets killed, and *<span id="Noble Girls-boom"></span><strong id="boom">boom</strong>* they are reborn into the life of a villainess who is set to die in the near future. Therefore, in order for the reincarnated girl to survive, they decide to correct their mistakes and/or become a better person to not fucking die. You would think that this would mean that the genre would be filled of really people trying their best at any chance they have right? Nope. Quite the opposite. This genre is full of stupid main characters. If you saw Bakarina, you would know exactly what I am talking about. And if you haven't, just think of harem protagonists except they are female. In all honestly, it's pretty much a reverse harem, but instead of ecchi you will get typical romcom moments. Look, I know it sounds pretty dumb, but it's honestly a very fun genre (which is why it's one of my favorite genres)! However, wouldn't it be cool if instead of acting saint/dumb idiot, the main character makes sure no one can kill her?
</p>

<p>
Personally, I found that idea much more interesting and less predictable, so I started to look out for novels like this and I found one: The Villainess Reverses the Hourglass. The beginning of this Manhwa pretty much follows the unoriginal plot that I so boringly described (in fact, I almost dropped it because of this), however, if you read it a bit further you will start to realize something. Holy shit! Aria is a motherfucking lying ass bitch. This motherfucker only wants two things: revenge against her sister Mielle Roscent, and to have a good life. And she plans to her knowledge and every bit of her brain to achieve both goals. Honestly, she is the type of motherfucker whom you would call a leech: she makes friendship with someone only because of their future value. She is also pretty nuts for making her sister cry her tears off, and you know what? All the things she does only makes it the story much more better.
</p>

<p>
The reason why I love this Manhwa is precisely because Aria is a bitch. One that will not stop until her goals are accomplished. None of that "naive" shit other "noble girls" have. This woman will stab you in the back, and somehow will make it look like it was your fault. Aria brings her cruelness into the table that no other noble girl protagonist really can. Furthermore, the art is pretty gorgeous: from the dresses, the way everything is portrayed, to how amazing Aria looks - it offers a scenery for everyone.
</p>

<p>
The only real problem I have with this story is that Aria has a magical item that somehow doesn't have any side effects. I think this is incredibly dumb, and the item in question to be nerfed in order to make the story more balance towards Aria's enemies. Other than that, I would recommend anyone to read this shit when you have time.
</p>

Also if you have time or want to read another Noble Girl story, I would recommend "The Villainess Lives Twice" which is pretty similar to this story. However, I feel like the MC is a bit less crazy than Aria. ¯\<em>(ツ)</em>/¯
