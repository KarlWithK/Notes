Two and a half years. That's the time it took me to fully finish season one and two of K-On. Ok technically speaking it took me 9 months to finally force myself to watch episodes 23-24 of the second season. For some reason, I left it on hold after watching episode 22. It wasn't that the characters were boring, but the genre itself bored me. Nonetheless, I can now say that episode 23 was the best in the series. It exemplified what the anime was about. It was what prompted me to write a review for the series.

You see I am a very stubborn person that knows about his taste. The whole genre of slice of life is incredibly painful for me to watch. It makes me literally fall asleep. I don't like it and I will tell anyone who recommends me a SOL show that it was not my thing. I would rather do the actions the characters preform, then watch the character perform that action.

However, every once in a while a person has to try something new. Which is why I decided to watch it. Indeed, some episodes made me fall asleep due to the nature of the genre, but there was something that really captured my eye. The relationships of the cast. K On is a show about a band club run by girls. However, I would argue that the band part could be replaced by something else and the show would be pretty much be the same. Still it was a show about high school at its core and I could relate to that.

Truth of the matter is that the girls are what kept me invested in the show. Despite my hatred for slice of life, I was able to get through the show. Just something about them that made me watch them be together. They are hilarious to watch and they definitely bring a smile to my face. Plus the show has the best endings I have ever heard. The animation is pretty nice too. Honestly, it's a good show - just not meant for me. I also wished there was more complete songs that were played on the show, but hey it did what it promised it would do.

Overall 7/10, would not watch again. Enjoyed the faces.
