America is what I will call a weird milkshake. It has all sorts of cultures, and you would think that blending them together would make something disgusting, but it actually tastes ok - honestly it's actually good.

Today is America's independence day, and I thought it would be fun to talk how one specific ingredient made this milkshake the way it is. Japanese culture is perhaps one of the most subtle, yet, prominent things seen in American culture - at least media wise. Take a look at prominent children tv shows and you will send a trend: power rangers, Pokemon, dragon ball z. I am sure most of you guys have seen at least one of these shows, and <span id="Impact on America-wow"></span><strong id="wow">wow</strong> they are all anime. However, based on personal experience most people don't realize this. They think power rangers is an American show simply because of that fact that it's on nickelodeon. Obviously, this is wrong. Power rangers itself was directly dubbed from a japanese show called Super Sentai. Point is we have been bathed in Japanese media since a young age. And the fact that macys with their giant goku balloon or the success of pokemon go in the US demonstrates how ingrain these media have become to our popular culture. Don't even get me started on video games...

The prominence of Japanese media in America really started with Astro Boy. Back in the 1940s, Manga was only really in Japan albeit in a very different form then what we perceive it today. Everything changed when the fir- Astro boy was created in 1952 by Osamu Tezuka. In case you guys didn't know astro boy was a manga about a boy who turned robot. Now using his robotic body he fights crime. The manga really bloomed in Japan and when anime came out, it was one of the first to receive an animation. Business happen, and the show came to the US thanks to its popularity in Japan around . And it was a hit - going into the top hits of tv charts. Why? It was different. Instead of the flintstones, you now see this boy flying around fighting supervillains. Seeing the success of this show, many other shows were brought to the US and other countries (one of which was mazinger Z which I still love to this day). Of course since they came from Japan, they also brought Japanese culture.

Manga and Anime definitely influenced the popular culture in the US. Style wise I think many american shows can be seen having ties with Anime. Perhaps even too much *<span id="Impact on America-cough"></span><strong id="cough">cough</strong>* kimba the white lion and simba the lion king *<span id="Impact on America-cough"></span><strong id="cough">cough</strong>*. Then you have games like Pac-man, Mario, Street fighter that are game classics that define the gaming culture and standards. I'm sure we will be seeing more of this impact in the future. Till then, I will be just chilling playing pokemon rom hacks.
