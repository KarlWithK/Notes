Look I think we have all experienced going through that one cringy phase as avid anime watchers where we basically declare one anime as perfect. We do our best to defend it and take no mind to criticism. And you know what, I think some of that is ok. Sure basically you close your mind from learning new stuff, but you should be to love what you love. If you like something you don't need to listen to someone talking shit about it. It's your opinion. Do your own thing. You think boku no pico is the best anime as it was pro LGBT+ way before anything else? Go ahead brother: it's your choice.

However, there are people who take it up a level. Specifically, I would like to talk about two types of people. The first kind of fanboys are people who do that creepy asterisk thing. No I ain't talking about people who do it ironically ( like some of my friends do it but I know it's satire ), I am talking about the people who legit write like this *<span id="My Feelings towards anime culture-hello everyone"></span><strong id="hello everyone">hello everyone</strong>*. I have met 2 people online who nonironcally write like this. And I managed to convince one of them to stop it (after 2 years...). Look, I am unsure what is going through the minds of these people, but please don't write everything in asterisks.

The second type of fanboys that I dislike are people who directly threaten me for saying something remotely negative about their favorite anime. And when I say threaten, I mean like a death threat. I don't think I need to say much about this one, but doing this kinda of thing isn't cool.

<p>
Minor compliant goes to people who sexualize everything single female they see in a show.
</p>

<p>
Honestly, I haven't seen anyone in this group that fits exactly into any of these types, but I would like people in this community to be more accepting. Please don't turn into these types of people.
