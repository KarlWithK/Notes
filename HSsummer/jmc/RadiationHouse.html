Anime has it all.
</p>

<p>
Want to watch a show about awesome fireman? Checked. Want to see a person being hunted by their choices? Checked. Want to watch a show about a coke addict who plays video games everyday and somehow is happy with her self while her bother works all day? Sadly anime has that checked too. Seriously, I am pretty sure an anime for just about every profession exists. And there is probably going to be an isekai anime for just about every household item too. Point is that anime has something for everyone.

Recently there has been a manga that I have been reading. And I have been keeping an eye on it for about 9ish months. I can't say it's a perfect manga by any means, but Radiation House (<a href="https://myanimelist.net/manga/93561/Radiation_House)">https://myanimelist.net/manga/93561/Radiation_House)</a> has got me hooked.
</p>

<p>
It's pretty hard to describe what has got me hooked exactly. It's not really special. In fact and honestly, it's about an overpowered anime (knowledgeable) main character who is a radiology technician - he works at a hospital and looks at images. Except he can do everything - even better than an actual doctor. He is apparently a detective too. Thus, in essence he is a boring character. 
</p>

<p>
However, like every profession anime/manga out there, the author manages to make the story interesting. You walk through this manga's world by looking at the eye of the MC, but instead on focusing on him you will focus on the stories of the patients. The patients and their stories are what make this manga interesting. You can't help to feel that these stories happen in real life too, and that for some people an ambulance will be the last thing they see.

Radiation House has great potential, and despite the fact that the main character is boring, I am very excited to read it every week. It truly manages to catch and reveal the hard choices medical experts have to make every day. And as a person who knew nothing about these things, it has educated me. Perhaps it can do the same to you too.
