Part 1:
Manga is certainly a medium that has reached various audience with its black and white panels. The style and artistic choices artists make to make their story pop out within the chapter is astonishing. A good example would be the ever famous Berserk written and illustrated by Kentaro Miura, simply said the amount of detail a single scene a chapter of his can have only allows this masterpiece to shine more. I'm not an artist myself, however, I'm pretty sure that many would fail to display the same amount of creativity and gore his art has. The gruesomeness of this epic tale is amplified by a lack of colors that is one of the unique qualities that manga has.

Nonetheless, as much as the black and white nature of manga helps horror stories with their vibe, many prefer the use of pigments reflecting on their eyes. Without certain doubt, color is one of the many reasons individuals crave an animation for their favorite manga. And who would blame them? Adding color to almost any scene doubles the qualities of the panel: I would dare say it makes it better.
</p>

<p>
With that concept in mind, it's straight forward to see that combining the qualities of manga and color would become a popular hit. Unsurprisingly, two different mediums came from the resemblance of this idea: Manhua and Manhwa. Manhua are Chinese comics and Manhwa are Korean comics - thing is they both are pretty similar with their panels being read in a vertical fashion, being made for online consumption, and, of course, both displaying color.

Honestly, chances are that if you have read manga, you have met these genres (honestly, I am not sure why I wrote this whole post ¯\<em>(ツ)</em>/¯). That being said, I would like to emphasize that there are some pretty cool and great stories from these two genres. In case you need some recommendations: there is the ever famous solo leveling, tower of god, or one of my favorites: Orange Marmalade (which I will be making a tiny review later). I guess you can call this genre webtoons btw(?).

Look just read some of these stories if you need convincing. They are pretty great.
