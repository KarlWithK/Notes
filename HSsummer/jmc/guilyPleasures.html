Guilty Pleasures 
</p>

<p>
Anime / manga is pretty weird if you think about it. Even disregarding the cultural difference between Japan and America, I am pretty sure you can see that is definitely a gray area in both media. I mean I am pretty sure this is the reason why Japan media has been stigmatized in American culture. This is why you see the shaming of people who like anime (well apart from the fact that usually anime fans are pretty noisy).

I'm unsure how to do a smooth transition into this point, but I just wanted to communicate that you should be free to talk about you guilty pleasures. Now I don't mean to sound weird nor am I trying to say that you should talk about your kinks to strangers, but I want to say that hopefully you will be comfortable to talk about hobbies to your friends. I'm not even talking about anime/manga specifically, but I truly believe that you should be able to share what you like. If people mock you, then you should probably get some new friends.

The reason why I am bring up this point is because I truly feel that people don't say they are into anime because of the shame culture around it. Some people think they will be made fun for watching cartoons. Now, I am NOT trying to say we are suppressed by anyone, but I sure that people know what it's like having some people call you disgusting because of some idea they have about anime. Particularly, that you probably watch hentai or that anime is just hentai. Look I am unsure of whether people actually feel this way, but there are definitely some that feel anime is just hentai. While they are definitely wrong, these rumors still spread. Combine this with the fact that a lot of Japanese media fans are cringy, and BOOM! you have a shame culture around it.

Luckily day be day, there are people who are "coming out" and announcing their enjoyment of anime. People like Brendon Urie, KSI, Kanye West, Logic, JoeyBadA$$, or even PewdiePie are allowing Anime into a more mainstream audience. Personally, I love this. It gives anime more fans.

One of the goals that this club had in mind when we charter it was to convince people what Japanese culture was not. I am sure that some people never stop making fun of people's hobbies, but in a few years some people's guilty pleasures can come to light.
