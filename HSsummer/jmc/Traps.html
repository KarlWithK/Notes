TLDR: Be respectful and mind your words. If not consequences will follow.

I'm not a good moderator. When it comes to moderating people, I would never delete anything they say. The main two reasons for this are that I am not decisive, and that I truly believe no one should ever get censored on what they say. That being said just because you aren't censored doesn't mean consequences won't follow.

Recently, there has been a political discussion on r/Animemes. I say discussion, but in all honestly, it seems like a real mess. This discussion is centered around the word "Trap" and its association to "Transphobia". Just to clear everything up, the term "Trap" refers to an individual who crosses dress the opposite gender. The term is usually used on male characters who wear women clothing. Transphobia on the other hand is the hatred and active discrimination of the transgender community. In short, the moderators of r/Animemes decided to ban all mentions of the word "Trap" in their Subreddit as some people felt that it was transphobic and a slur to the transgender community. And the aftermath of that were many people having differing opinions on the word. Mostly, the people opposed to this ban concluded that only a small amount of individuals felt offended by the term, and that it wasn't really a slur, and the banned should be appealed. After finally reading both sides of the argument and a long walk, I made up my mind about this discussion, and would like to write some things down.

Anime has always been an escape to some people. Whether it is the popularity of isekai or the huge amount of slice-of-life anime, there is definite and clear proof we can use to make assumptions: some people use anime to relax and be in another world. And that's fine. People should be allowed to just watch a show and relax. Nonetheless, the most probable reason why many use anime as a means to escape is probably because there is something going on their lives they wish to get away from. At least that was the case for me. Anime just always made me feel better and not think about factors I could not control. And I'm sure others feel the same. Given this is the case and that so many of us are uncomfortable of our lives, I think it's rather insulting to our own feelings to not take into consideration what a group of people could feel when we use words that could make them feel uncomfortable in the community. This should apply no matter how small that group could be. Perhaps, you could feel indifferent to what I am saying, but I would like to remind you that just because you aren't suffering a specific problem doesn't mean another person isn't.

That being said, context does matter. I'm still not sure whether it's a slur or not, but either way I made up my mind. Personally, I would never delete your message in any circumstances, however, like I said before your words do have consequences. This might not work in that specific Subreddit, but thankfully we are small enough where we (the mods) can seem every message. Therefore, if I see any comment that is without question offensive or downright just aimed at someone in our community for these issues, I will talk it out with the leaders of the club and just report you to the school. Personally, I think that's worse fate then just being censored. However, I know it's a better solution then not doing anything. Of course, context does matter - but I'm sure most people can see when someone is just being toxic.

Truthfully, I am still feeling conflicted about this whole mess since I myself have indulged in that language. I would go as far to say that I probably might have offended someone with the way I use the term, and to that I apologize. But, I think this is a simple matter of just being a good person. Words impact people. Your message might just straight up hurt someone. I don't really think I am asking a lot, so as a terrible moderator I'm asking you to just be mindful of your messages from now on.
</p>

<p>
Either way, I would like to have a discussion if you disagree or just have any thoughts on what I said. I will respond when I can.
