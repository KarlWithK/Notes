The language and the compiler:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
In order to make it easier to reaso about programs, Rust neds to place some restrictions on the programs you can write.

<ul>
<li>
This makes it difficult (sometimes impossible) to write certain programs in safe Rust

</ul>
<li>
A lot of the cool guarantees we get from Rust come the checks its compiler performs

</ul>

<p>
Rust can sometimes exceed the performance of C because of compiler optimizations.
</p>
 
<p>
How does rust prevent us from making the making the errors we made?
Ownership:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The reason you ran into trouble when decomposing your code!

<li>
Ownership Rules:

<ul>
<li>
First, let's take a look at the ownership rules. Keep these rules in mind as we work through the examples the illustrate them:

<ul>
<li>
Each value in Rust has a variable that's called its owner.

<li>
There can only be one owner at a time.

<li>
When the owner goes out of scope, the value will dropped.

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Controlling references to resources is a broader idea in systems programming that isn't unique to Rust.

<li>
That means you can no longer use it in main!

<li>
Lifetimes:

<ul>
<li>
The lifetime of a vlaue starts when it's created and ends the last time it's used

<li>
Rust doesn't let you have a reference to a value that last longet than the value's lifetime

<li>
Rust computes lifetimes at compile time using static analysis (this is often an over-approximation)

<li>
Rust calls the special "drop" funciton of 

</ul>
</ul>
