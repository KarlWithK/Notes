CS110:
</p>

<p>
Why Rust:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Why not C/C++?

<li>
Why not GC'ed languages (java, python, Go, etc).

<ul>
<li>
GC = garbage collector

</ul>
<li>
Push the arguments into the stack and call functions.

<li>
Pop off stack.

<li>
C does not do bounds checks, so you can overwrite memory. Haven't gone off the stack, but you can overwrite the return address.

<li>
Bad people can supply a pointer with own assembly code and will create a bomb. :(

<li>
Buffer overflow -&gt; write random data that isn't good.

<li>
Morris Worm (circa 1988) -&gt; FingerD send info to computers to send querry, but.

<li>
gets(line) -&gt; might get a buffer overflow.

<li>
gets() -&gt; c function that reads from stdin. Haven't told how big that region of memory. Not sufficient memory.

<li>
All...C code is dangerous.

<li>
Latest version and countless issues.

<li>
Dealing with these issues

<li>
Valgrind -&gt; tells you about problem that happened not the problems that haven't happened. Doesn't realize there

<ul>
<li>
Dynamic analysis

</ul>
<li>
Made a lot of progress but there is still a lot of problems.

</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Why not use GC'ed languages. Java is just like I want an array.

<li>
Would just make everyone dependent of this.

</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Huge benefits. VERY EXPENSIVE - no matter what type of garbage collection is used, there will always be nontrivial memory overhead.

<li>
Disruptive:

<ul>
<li>
Drop what you're doing - it's time for GC.

</ul>
<li>
Non-deterministic:

<ul>
<li>
When will the next GC pause be? Who knowns! Depends on how much memory is being used

</ul>
<li>
Precludes manual optimization:

<ul>
<li>
In some situations, you may want to structure you data in memory in a specific way in order to achieve high cache performance.

<li>
GC can't know how you will use memory, so it optimizes for the average use case.

</ul>
<li>
Latency matters:

<ul>
<li>
User interfaces

<li>
Games

<li>
Self-driving cars

<li>
Payment processing

<li>
High Frequency trading

</ul>
</ul>

<p>
Garbage collectors aren't all about safety.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Later in the quarter, we'll learn about race conditions

<li>
Garbage collections does not preclude race conditions! Memory safety issues persist even in garbage-collected environments.

</ul>
