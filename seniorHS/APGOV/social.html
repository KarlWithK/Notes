Would the United States be a better country if we could go back to the media environment of the time before cable news, the internet and social media?  Explain your position!
</p>

<p>
"Ignorance is bliss". 
</p>

<p>
In the broad sense, the citizens of America and their interests are the deciding factor in the way the United States runs. However, because of idea of factions, many groups have decided to only pursue their interests - to only look for themselves. From the prospective of biology this makes sense: to survive people will prioritize their needs - there is nothing wrong wanting to survive. Yet, a country is more than one person: America is comprised of millions of people. As such, the idea of just thinking for one's self is not what a country needs. It would be too inefficient. A country would need to know what the majority of people need to become a better version of itself. However, problems arise on how would people know what the majority of people want? Or what are the urgent issues we need to address as a country? Or even, how is America doing compared to the world - how can we improve?
</p>

<p>
The answer is quite simply communication. But with a population with ours, which is so widespread, communication though person to person would be too slow and too biased. If you only listen to your neighbors, you won't get the full picture of how America is doing. If you only read your's city newspaper, you won't get an accurate representation of how America as a whole is doing. You would just be limited to one area. You may be ignorantly believing all is right with the world. Yet, with the introduction of national cable news, the internet, and social media, we know this clearly isn't right - there are many, many, many problems. Many of which were only revealed because of his new media environment.

<p>
This new environment has allowed people from across the country to hear and see what disasters are occurring. Take the California fires, as a New Yorkers, we would never experience such a climate unless we personally went there. Yet, through this brand new form of communication, the doors have been opened to discovering what issues we need to address; as a country we were given the opportunity to view how issues impacted us the most. At the center of this experience was information communicated through Social Media. No longer were we just limited to the scope of the location we lived in, but now through this media all Americans could see an overview of what is really happening.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps, one may argue, the radio could have done this, but they would be undermining how quickly the information was delivered, and how visuals help people understand the problem. This new environment was able to delivered this information and impact people at a rate which the old media could simply not compared.
