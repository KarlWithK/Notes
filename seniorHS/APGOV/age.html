One of the biggest things I regret is not giving myself enough credit. Instead of boasting of what I could do as a high school student, I decided that it was more reasonable to be humble and downplay my experience at coding. I expected praise for attempting to make a good youtube video as a student, but in the end, I received a terrible comment detailing that it was clear I was just a junior. Basically, they were telling me I was stupid for making the tutorial. Now that I look back at it there is one thing that I am sure of: people do not take teenagers seriously.

The constitution of the US is supposed to be progressive, yet, there is one thing that left me wondering as I read through it: in the legislative branch and executive branch there is an age requirement. Why? I mean it makes sense back when the constitution was created: they needed scholars to represent the country, , and I'm sure that these scholars wanted to communicate with people with the same age (or "status"). It was probably meant as a safety switch, but the more I think about it, the more I'm bothered by these requirements.

At Stuyvesant, I've met plenty of "smart" people. It wasn't their grades that impressed me, but how they applied their knowledge to projects. I know some that started protests or boycotts to show their disapproval to major problems. Some of my classmates even got on news. Yet, at the end of the day, it doesn't matter. Look at Greta Thunberg and how her stance on climate change. Despite her coverage, many simply don't accept her stance and why it's important. Instead she is critiqued for skipping school and doing something "stupid". Just like how I was called out for my video.

There are various kids my age who are ready. Ready to start working on changing the world. The only thing that is missing from their resume is experience. You are expected to go into college, and only then, could you get a job on something you are passionate about. However, I believe you don't need to go to college to realize that you can help out in the government. I would like to think that experience is the factor that determines the chance of being hired. For example, take a look at Computer Science: there are many people who don't have a college degree. Still, many companies realized that a worker can learn the skills they needed while working. That they can earn experience as they work. In programming, you don’t need to know everything since you can always search it up online, which is why a college degree is unnecessary in many cases. The only thing you need is proof, such as projects, that you are ready and motivated for the job.

To be a Representative you need to be twenty-five, a Senator thirty, and the President needs to be thirty-five. Fundamentally, it makes sense that founding fathers wanted an age requirement: it's more likely for a person to be wise the older they are. Yet that always isn't the case. There are some adults that never grow up. I've read this on Reddit, but I think it's quite a statement,"adults are just grown up kids". Basically everyone is a kid and some people will never learn. Since that is the case, I believe having an age requirement is fundamentally absurd. Getting rid of this requirement would bring unprecedented benefits. For example, the possibility of having a president that truly understands the current generation and isn't a seventy plus senior. In addition, I believe that students are much more motivated just after getting out of high school and before working: having the opportunity to represent the government at 22 would probably inspire many. Finally, students will finally get the experience they need. As I mentioned before, some of these kids are ready - it's just that many undermine the capability of teenagers.

Perhaps, I’m just speaking rubbish, but I think this would cause many chances in society. If we got rid of the stigma of teenagers being stupid, I’m sure many of my classmates would be able to come up with plans to make the world better. Therefore, I believe that the age requirement in the constitution should be eliminated.
