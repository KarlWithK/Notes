I'm not American. Nor am I Mexican. If I had to label myself I would say I'm just a citizen of the internet. The thing I care about the most was the internet, but somehow this led me into leaning into the "left".
</p>

<p>
The internet has always been a source of creativity and knowledge. As long as you had an idea of what to look for, you would be able to learn something about the subject. From the birth of that knowledge, you would be may be able to create something. From a young age I was able to teach myself so many things from just searching around the web. The internet was my home and I wanted to keep it safe, but I also wanted to make everyone care about it as much as I did. I wanted to make everyone have a place on the web.
</p>

<p>
However, the internet has never been a "friendly" place. If one venture too far, or spent too much time on a site, it was likely that they would be frightened away. In fact, often I would hear of many people being humiliated on the web. The internet was supposed to be this place where people could collaborate, yet, the sites I loved the most became toxic. Even with my favorite software piece, Vim, this spread.

Bram Moolenaar is a personal idol of mine - after all he did created Vim. However, recently, his stubbornness has made me realized that "supporting" radical change isn't that bad - instead it's something that should be expected. A few months ago, Bram was asked to accept an update to the change the documentation for Vim. In essence, the update would make it so the documentation would no longer assume the reader is male, and change every pronoun to be gender-neutral. Bram decided to close the issue, and at first, I thought it was not really needed, but then I asked myself why would it not? Statistically, white men dominate Computer Science, yet, originally the job was a "women's job". Vim was about forty years old - many use it. If I decided to not include women/non-binary, wouldn't that mean I wasn't supporting myself - a latino? So I had to ask myself why would Bram decide to not accept the update? I couldn't come up with an answer.

If you look it from an overview there are many projects like Vim. There are many open-source projects; projects that are supposed to represent the freedom of the internet. However, how can they represent freedom, if they support everyone in their own documentation? It makes no sense. Logic fallacies like this are what prompted me to care and support rights for everyone. In my opinion, everyone should be represented, and it seems that being in the democratic party fit this motive. 
</p>

<p>
The internet has always been a part of me. I think many use the service, but not many care about the political issues surrounding it like me. In either case, thanks to the it, I have been able to see the suppression of many groups. I'm unsure of what exactly I can do, but I would like to make the internet a better place for all.
