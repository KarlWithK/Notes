To what degree is it fair for the states to take the lead in policymaking due to their closer proximity to the people? Explain!
</p>

<p>
Democracy in America works under the principle of federalism: a system where our government is divided under the federal government and state governments. The constitution was written in such a way that both forms of government had to work with each other to keep America going. In most cases they had to cooperate as most serious issues involved changes that would require both parties. For example, in order for a law to be passed said law would have to be passed by congress, members who are elected by the state, and the president - the head of the federal government. In this way, as Madison implied in the federalist #45, the states would have power over the federal government. It is for this reason, however, that states have more influence than the federal government, which is completely fair.

Due to the farmers' views on factions on the time, the constitution was set up to support the status quo - to remain stable. This results in the federal government not being able to make massive changes due to the check and balance set up across the three branches. As such, if there were ever society issue on the rise or change of perspective for an issue, the process to reform would take an incredible amount of time or congress would operate but with a catch for the states. This stable federal government is a great concept for making sure that America prospers, but for Americans it is taxing to have to wait for the slow member in the group to do their part.

Many issues cannot wait forever as Martin Luther King Jr. once said, "This 'wait' has almost always meant 'never'". If there isn't change happening, then  it probably won't happened. Take for instance gay marriage in America: it was only until May 17, 2004, that a same-sex couple could get married in Massachusetts, yet, for many Americans this was an issue that they wanted for years. It wasn't until 2015 that the supreme court, part of the federal government, made gay marriage legal in all 50 states. That is eleven years that members of the LBGT community had to wait. People want issues resolved. It is the job of the lower courts of each state to hear the people out. Only then, can an issue be brought into the supreme court. Since this is the case, it without question that it's fair for the states to lead in policymaking. After all, it would take years for the everyday man's issue to be heard on a federal level.
