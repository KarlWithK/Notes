What is policy? How is it made and how is it changed—how does it interact with governments?  What competing theories are there that attempt to best explain why certain policies become reality while others do not?
</p>

<p>
Public policy represents the actions that the government takes to face a social or economic issue. In a sense, they are the output of the government that reinsure the people they understand problems are happening. The course of actions the government takes is decided by the policymaking system. A system that looks at the government's political agenda to decide which issues are the most urgent that must be addressed. This means a policy always starts with an issue that the people care about, and through political institutions such as Congress, the policies that are made will affect people. It's a cycle surrounding the people. However, the way the government picks which issues are urgent is sill debated. In a sense there are three theories that reason why some policies never make it: pluralism, hyperpluralism, and elitism.
</p>

<p>
Pluralism surrounds the idea of factions: people who have similar values group together to press their concerns. Factions allows the government to hear out the concern of minority group, which all complete for certain policies to be made. However, because America is so diverse and huge, there is a numerous amount of factions that have become so powerful to a point that the government isn't making the policies, the factions are. This is the theory of hyperpluralism - there are many strong factions with diverse interests that the government can't decide which issue is most important to all Americans. The last theory, elitism, describes how it is the rich that make the policies - they are the policymakers. In this way, the interests of poor Americans are not really taken into consideration; only when the rich must do they make policies for the poor. These are the three theories that might rule our policy making.

<span id="TEST 1-Chapter 2—The Constitution"></span><strong id="Chapter 2—The Constitution">Chapter 2—The Constitution</strong>
Explain why the Framers constructed the Constitution as they did.  What were they reacting to?  What were the key compromises?  What was the method they created for changing it?  Explain.
</p>

<p>
But as much as people want a specific policy, it's up judges to decided whether it was constitutional. On September 17, 1787, the founding fathers met in Philadelphia to build a new government for the thirteen colonies. They wanted to created a template that would replace the articles of confederation - a structure that did not have enough power to tax the states. In order to address this point, the farmers made sure that Constitution would have the power to tax, add new states, and in the future regulate commerce. The farmers were able to do this this by giving rights to the states and the federal government. The federal government was now structured with checks and balance to secure its stability. With the Connecticut Compromise, the legislative branch was split into two: the house of representatives and the Senate, and each state had a certain amount of power. The three-fifths compromise ensured that southern states would join, and with the inclusion of Electoral college they made sure that people would vote for a leader they wanted. The Constitution was written to last. To certified this was the case, the farmers created Article V of the Constitution which outlined how to create amendments: a change to the text of the Constitution. By outlining how to make a proposal, a two-third vote or through a National Convention, and by only allowing an amendment to be ratified by a majority, it would ensure that the Constitution could change when it needed to.

What are the key tenets of Federalism that distinguish it from unitary and confederal forms of government?  How did we end up with it in the USA and what are some of its key advantages and disadvantages? Finally, how are questions of states v. the federal government resolved?
</p>

<p>
While confederate systems like Articles of Confederation had a weak national government to reinforce new laws, and a unitary system had too much central power, the farmers made sure that the states and federal government had tasks only they could accomplish. This federal system was developed to reinforce Americans in the 18th century that their states would not lose power, but instead they the people and the states would gain more power by ratifying the Constitution. The way the system worked was that states could have their own government, and in addition, the people would vote for members of the House, Senate, and of course the president. In this way the people were indirectly in control of how America would progress. The advantages were clear: a government that would represent most Americans, a central power to declare wars, and a stable nation. However, at the same time, some laws introduced in states would not be enforced everywhere. It was up to the federal government to introduce national laws. In some cases, these two layers of government conflicted, and it was left up to the judicial branch to decide who is in the right. However with the supremacy clause, most often or not, it was the federal government that was right. The clause was introduce by the Supreme Court of the United States. Overall, with its policies, the Constitution, and its federalist nature America is a country that changed according to time.
