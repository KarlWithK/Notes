All C primatives are numeria types. All

<li>
The only difference is the size of the variable and whether it is an integer or floating point

<li>
size can be platform dependent, but there are general standards

<ul>
<li>
sizeof(type) will return the size of a data type or variable

</ul>
</ul>

Char is an integer type, but can be used to reger to character literals as well.

<ul>
<li>
char c = 97; and char = 'a'; are both equally valid statements

</ul>

<ul>
<li>
C is statically types, meaning every variable must be given a type.

<li>
Variables must be declared before they are used.

<ul>
<li>
You can assign a variable a value at declaration (i.e int x = 10;)

</ul>
<li>
There is not default value for variables

<ul>
<li>
In java, everything got initialized to 0, that's a thing of the past.

<li>
Remember that declaring a variable means requesting a piece of memory to be used by your program of the corresponding variable size (int means you are asking for 4 bytes of memory).

<li>
If you do initialized a variable, it's inital value will be whatever happens to be in the piece of memory that was assigned to your variable. Sometimes, that's 0, sometimes it some other number. Who knows?

</ul>
<li>
variables can be declared as unsigned (i.e unsigned int u;)

<ul>
<li>
unsigned variables have a lower bound of 0 and a higher upper bound than their signed counterparts.

<li>
unsigned char uc; 

</ul>
</ul>
