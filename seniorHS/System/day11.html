<p>
Dynamic memory allocation:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
malloc(size_t x):

<ul>
<li>
Allocates x bytes of heap memory

<li>
Returns the address at the beginning of the allocation

<li>
Returns a void *
<pre c>
		int *p;
		p = malloc( 5 * sizeof(int) )
</pre>

</ul>
<li>
free(void *p)

<ul>
<li>
Releases dynamically allocated memory.

<li>
Has one parameter, a pointer to the beginning of a dynamically block of memory

<li>
Every call ato malloc/calloc should have a corresponding call to free

</ul>
<li>
free(void * p)

<ul>
<li>
Releases dynamically allocated memory.

<li>
Has one parameter, a pointer tao the beginning of a dynamically allocated block of memory

<li>
Every call at mallow/calloc should have a corresponding call at free

</ul>
<li>
calloc(size_t n, size_t x)

<ul>
<li>
allocates n * x bytes of memory, ensuring every bit is 0

<li>
Works like mallow in all other ways
<pre c>
		int*p;
		p = calloc(5, sizeof(int));
</pre>

</ul>
<li>
realloc(void *p, size_t x)

<ul>
<li>
Changes the amount of memory allocated for a block to x bytes

<li>
P must point to the beginning

<li>
Returns a pointer to the beginning of the block (this is not always the same as p)

<li>
If x is smaller than the original size of the allocation, the extra bytes will be released

<li>
if x is larger than the original size then either:

<ul>
<li>
if there is enough space at the end of the original allocation, the original allocation will be updated

<li>
If there is not enough space, a new allocation will be created, containing all the original values. The orginal allocation will be fried.

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
