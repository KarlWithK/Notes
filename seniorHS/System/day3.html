<ul>
<li>
Function and variables names are both examples or identifiers

<li>
An identifiers must b declared before they can be used

<li>
A function declaration provides its return type, name, and parameters. This is also known as a function header.

<li>
dobule dylan(int jack);

</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Compiler are more complex than straightfoward source code -&gt; executable code, translators, and have multiple componets

<li>
To start, we'll look at three major pieces of gcc, the preprocessor compiler, and the linker

</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Preprocessor:

<ul>
<li>
The preprocessor is, at it's simplest (interperation, a text replacement system).

<li>
Modifies source code file with text, as opposed to binary data.

<li>
All preprocessor commands start with # (i.e #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;)

<li>
Not that preprocessor directives do not end in ;

<li>
A few basic preprocessor directives:

<ul>
<li>
#include:

<ul>
<li>
adds the entire of the included file

</ul>
<li>
#define:

<ul>
<li>
Usuage: #define Text_Replace

<li>
WIll replace every instance of Text with the provided replacement

<li>
Examples:

<ul>
<li>
#define PI 3.14

</ul>
<li>
Note tha define does not use =, because this is not an assignment

<li>
You can also use #define to declare function-like macros:

<ul>
<li>
#define MAX(a,b) a&gt; b ? a : b

<li>
MAX(x,y) would turn into x &gt; y ? x:y

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
#ifdef IDENTIFER ... #endif:

<ul>
<li>
Conditional preprocessor statement.

<li>
If IDENTIFER is not defined (for the preprocessor), then include all the lines of code up to the #endif

<li>
if IDENTIFER is defined, skip everyting up to the #endif

<li>
Examples

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Compilers:

<ul>
<li>
Turns C source code into binary code

<li>
the result is not an executable program.

<li>
Only one C file is compiled at a time

<li>
The compiler checks called functions against their declared headers, but if a function is defined in a separate file, its code is not added at this step

<li>
<code>$ gcc -c &lt;FILE&gt;</code> will run the preprocessor and compile stages only, creating a non executable binary object file. The resulting file will have an extension of .o

<li>
Since an executable is not created, you can usually compile, via '$gcc -c', a C file that does not have a main function

</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Linker:

<ul>
<li>
Combines compiled binary code from multiple files into a single executable program

<li>
Will automatically look for standard library source code, or anything that can be included using &lt;&gt;.

<li>
if mutliple definitions for any identifier is found, the linker will fail.

<li>
Must find one definition for main.

<li>
if you provide gcc multiple files. it will compile each one individual and then run the linker on them together

<li>
if you provide gcc any .o files, it will skip the compilation step for those files and then use them during linking.

<li>
you cna mix and match .co and .o files gcc, but it is not encouraged.

<li>
For example these would be good ways to compile a program, if you had files foo.c goc.

</ul>
</ul>
