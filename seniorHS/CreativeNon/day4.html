What was the most helpful thing you learned/heard from a fellow writer in your Workshop group?

</ol>
<p>
I think the middle section of my essay was the weakest part, and by having multiple people reading my essay I understood what to change. For example, Oscar Chi gave me the advise to delete my metaphors because it didn't makes sense for my piece.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
What, if anything, are you left wondering? What, if anything, are you confused or uncertain about?

</ol>
<p>
Honestly, I am still not sure whether my ending of my essay is impactful and  whether it brings my essay together. I think my piece is silly but I like it. However, the ending was supposed to bring it together and I'm not sure if it does that.

<ol>
<li>
On a scale of 0 to 5 (0 = not at all, 5 = pretty much perfectly), how aligned were your intentions for your essay and your readersâ€™ reception of it? 

</ol>
<p>
4 - I wrote my essay to be humorous and I think that was the point that my readers got, however, I am not sure if it's interesting. I wanted to make it sarong and I am not sure if people will think that.

What is your main focus for getting your essay ready for the second workshop?

</ol>
<p>
The ending. I like my first two paragraphs, but I always struggle with making the second half great. I am trying to aim for a more solid essay.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Did everyone stick to the protocol to talk about each writer in the third person?

</ol>
<p>
No I didn't :(. However, I think I gave them valid and constructive criticism. Hopefully, this is ok?
</p>
<ol>
<li>
How did your editors do in terms of sticking to "I"-centered and "might" rather than "should" phrasing?

</ol>
<p>
I think we all did great in this department. Well I could do better, overall we all we weren't too critical of another person.
