I believe whatever Tracy Liu was important. Sometimes, I am trying to amake my writing more fancy be using a word that fits. However, this usually wastes my time. I find it that usually it just better to describe about what you want to write about it then finding a better word. Unless there is word count.

Cheng Ma is also something I liked. Because I try worrying about the grammar.
