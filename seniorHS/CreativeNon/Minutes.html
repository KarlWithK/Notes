Hello, my name is Karl Hernandez and these are Minutes for Wednesday, October 7th.
</p>

<p>
For our class on Monday, our aim was "(How) does 'A Big Life' function as a personal essay".
</p>

<p>
We began class by reviewing 'A Big Life' in breakout rooms and discussed what we liked about the piece and how it told a story. My team said that author narrated personal information to convince us of a point - debt for everyone isn't good. After  breakout rooms finished, we had a class discussion where we spoke about how the author made great use of duologue, and how the author managed to embedded an image to tell us a story. The image of her having 16 jobs. One thing that stood out to me was when Evan mentioned that although there appeared that the story didn't have a structure, it actually does - all stories don't need to be 5 paragraphs long. After that we had some prompts, and wrote a bit. Finally, we were introduced to our first writing assignment: The Narrative Personal Essay (<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dpw53Ltz8P62fUY59OAR8aSP9KOGfe3o/view)">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dpw53Ltz8P62fUY59OAR8aSP9KOGfe3o/view)</a> with no specific due date.
</p>

<p>
The homework due today was to answer the questions about the NYT essays on google classroom, spend some time in your WN, and to think of a topic for NPE.
</p>

<p>
Minutes next class will be delivered by Kyron Liu on Friday, October 9th.

A python script to know the current period and how much time you have left for said class. Extremely light weight, and since it's modular you can combine it with other things.
