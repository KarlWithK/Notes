My High-School Hoax
Teddy Wayne
</p>

<p>
	I love the way the author created two different images of reality and his imagination. "I wasnâ€™t the common slacker, I believed; I was an ambitious slacker, someone who aggressively squandered his potential. And now I stood empty-handed and perspiring before five drum students." These sentences just gave me goosebumps and let me know that this person is just like me - a teenager. It was a realistic story that might apply to every stuy student, and the way the author added dialogue made the story pop out.

The Undress Code

	What interested me was the title, and thankfully it got me somewhere. I liked the way Tsui was able to tell a powerful political message by telling her own story and it sticks. She is a writer herself, and she was able to stand up against this creepy man. I feel like the best thing she did was to include the creepy comments the man said, but not directly say he was creepy. She knew the readers would be able to fill in the gap. I am going to use this knowledge to make my essays better.
